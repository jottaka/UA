How, if at all, should primary care providers respond? In this paper, I want to shed light on this issue by focusing on the role that ‘big data’ might play in allowing primary care providers to respond to the social determinants that affect individual patients’ health. The general idea has been proposed and endorsed by the Institute of Medicine, and the idea has been developed in more detail by Bazemore et al. (2016). In Bazemore et al.’s proposal, patients’ addresses are used to generate information about the patients’ neighbourhood; this information is then included in patients’ health care records and made available to providers. This allows primary care providers to take this information into account when interacting with, and providing care to, patients. I explore three issues arising from this proposal. First, while questions of privacy have been central to discussions about big data, Bazemore et al.’s proposal also allows us to see that there might be costs to not making certain information available. Second, I consider some of the questions arising for primary care from the influence of social factors on health outcomes: given that we know these factors to be significant contributors to social inequalities in health, what precisely should be done about this in the primary care context? Finally, I address problems arising from the use of population level data when dealing with individuals. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Big data; Equality; Equity; Health inequality; Social determinants of health","","","","","","","","Baeroe K., Bringedal B., Just health: On the conditions for acceptable and unacceptable priority settings with respect to patients’ socioeconomic status, Journal of Medical Ethics, 37, 9, pp. 526-529, (2011); Bazemore A., Phillips R.L., Miyoshi T., Harnessing geographic information systems (GIS) to enable community-oriented primary care, Journal of Map & Geography Libraries, 7, 1, pp. 71-86, (2011); Bazemore A.W., Cottrell E.K., Gold R., Hughes L.S., Phillips R.L., Angier H., Burdick T.E., Carrozza M.A., Et al., Community vital signs”: incorporating geocoded social determinants into electronic records to promote patient and population health, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association: JAMIA, 23, 2, pp. 407-412, (2016); Braveman P., Egerter S., Williams D.R., The social determinants of health: coming of age, Annual Review of Public Health, 32, pp. 381-398, (2011); Burgess D.J., Fu S.S., Van Ryn M., Why do providers contribute to disparities and what can be done about it?, Journal of General Internal Medicine, 19, 11, pp. 1154-1159, (2004); Comer K.F., Grannis S., Dixon B.E., Incorporating geospatial capacity within clinical data systems to address social determinants of health, Public Health Reports, 126, pp. 54-61, (2011); Fiscella K., Epstein R., So much to do, so little time: care for the Socially Disadvantaged and the 15-minute visit, Archives of Internal Medicine, 168, 17, pp. 1843-1852, (2008); FitzGerald C., Hurst S., Implicit bias in healthcare professionals: a systematic review, BMC Medical Ethics, 18, 19, (2017); Furler J.S., Palmer V.J., The ethics of everyday practice in primary medical care: responding to social health inequities, Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine, 5, 1, (2010); Garg A., Jack B., Zuckerman B., Addressing the social determinants of health within the patient-centered medical home: lessons from pediatrics, JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, 309, 19, pp. 2001-2002, (2013); Goddard M., Smith P., Equity of access to health care services: theory and evidence from the UK, Social Science and Medicine, 53, 9, pp. 1149-1162, (2001); Gwatkin D.R., Ergo A., Universal health coverage: friend or foe of health equity?, The Lancet, 377, 9784, pp. 2160-2161, (2011); Hargittai E., Is bigger always better?

Nor have there been sufficient cross-national comparisons of their perspectives. Relying on interviews with 98 tech workers in China and the US, this paper is guided by two questions: (1) What are tech workers' perceptions of big data ethics, and (2) what are the cross-national similarities and differences in China and the US? The study found that there are cross-national similarities in tech workers’ cautious enthusiasm about the applications of big data in their work, as well as in their complex and ambivalent ethical perspectives on the use of big data in government digital surveillance. The main cross-national differences occur in tech workers’ perceptions of whether big data may reinforce social inequalities. US-based tech workers are concerned about the reinforcement of race and gender-based inequalities through the use of big data, whereas their colleagues in China are optimistic that the use of big data may reduce income-based inequalities across geographical regions. The study's findings have implications for how to leverage tech workers’ influence and promote the ethical use of data and algorithms. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","big data; China; Ethics; technology; the US","","","","","","Bryce Nishikawa; Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University; Rice University; University of California, San Diego, UCSD; Templeton Religion Trust","Research for this paper was supported by the Science and Religion: Identity and Belief Formation funding initiative, led by Elaine Howard Ecklund (Rice University) and John H.

Digitalisation is again bringing about a radical change in capitalism and the Fordist production structure. Not only has digitalization created an entire new industry, but it is also fundamentally changing the production of classic Fordist industries such as the automotive sector. The Internet of Things, Big Data and artificial intelligence are revolutionising production processes and business models. The more efficient work and production processes generate productivity and welfare gains and promising growth opportunities for the future. However, the flip side of this development is accompanied by an increasingly unequal distribution of these gains. Despite the productivity gains, social inequality is rising in many industrialised countries, increasing the pressured on the welfare and social state through rising debt. This paper provides a theoretical explanation and prediction into how the ongoing digitalisation affects capitalism and what can be expected from this development for the future. The starting point of our consideration is the technological innovation in the course of the digital revolution changes on dominant structure of companies, which is discussed in the first part. In the second part, the consequences of this fourth industrial revolution for the macroeconomic and societal level, in particular the distribution of income, are examined. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","","","","","","","Buckley P.J., Casson M.C., The Future of the Multinational Enterprise, (1976); Buckley P.J., Casson M.C., The internalisation theory of the multinational enterprise: A review of the progress of a research agenda after 30 years, Journal of International Business Studies, 40, 9, pp. 1563-1580, (2009); Coase R.H., The nature of the firm, Economica, 4, 16, pp. 386-405, (1937); Cox R.W., Social forces, states and world orders: Beyond international relations theory, Millennium—Journal of International Studies, 10, 2, pp. 126-155, (1981); Cox R.W., Gramsci, hegemony and international relations: An essay in method, Millennium—Journal of International Studies, 12, 2, pp. 162-175, (1983); Dunning J.H., The eclectic paradigm of international production: A restatement and some possible extensions, Journal of International Business Studies, 19, 1, pp. 1-31, (1988); Dunning J.H., The eclectic (OLI) paradigm of international production.

The food sector, from this point of view, plays a strategic role. Poverty, malnutrition, hunger, climate change, and social inequalities are just some of the trends which the agri-food sector has to cope with. The digital transformation that companies will need to embrace to survive requires new ways of creating, thinking, and working with technology-driven tools to provide value for their businesses and customers. Digitization, whether it pertains to new technologies, the analysis of big data or the development of on-line and spatial applications, can contribute to achieving systemic food production transformation in a way that aligns the sector more closely with contemporary sustainability and health challenges. Digital techniques are leading established companies to renew and innovate their business models by connecting producers to consumers, setting up innovative marketing channels, and improving logistics. Artificial intelligence for smart farming, precision and urban farming, data management for waste-less, blockchain for supply chain traceability and auditability are just some of the disruptive technologies which have been adopting by both start-ups and an increasing number of established companies, redefining their business models. This chapter aims to analyse how these new paradigms are impacting the food sector by providing examples from the real world. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Business model; Business model innovation; Food industry; Grand challenges; Sustainability","","","","","","","","Abdelkafi N., Tauscher K., Business models for sustainability from a system dynamics perspective, Organization & Environment, 29, 1, pp. 74-96, (2016); Aguilera R.V., Rupp D.E., Williams C.A., Ganapathi J., Putting the S back in corporate social responsibility: A multilevel theory of social change in organizations, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 836-863, (2007); Allwood J.M., Squaring the circular economy: The role of recycling within a hierarchy of material management strategies, Handbook of Recycling, pp. 445-477, (2014); Amit R., Zott C., Creating value through business model innovation, MIT Sloan Management Review, 53, 3, pp. 36-44, (2012); Andersen M.S., An introductory note on the environmental economics of the circular economy, Sustainability Science, 2, 1, pp. 133-140, (2007); Bagnoli C., Massaro M., Bravin A., Vignotto A., Business Model 4.0 I Modelli Di Business Vincenti per Le Imprese Italiane Nella Quarta Rivoluzione Industriale.

SUMMARY ANSWER: In 2017, 6.7% of births were conceived by MAR (4.8% ART and 1.9% ovulation induction (OI)/IUI) with a 55% increase in ART births and a stable contribution from OI/IUI births over the past decade. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is considerable global variation in utilization rates of ART despite a similar infertility prevalence worldwide. While the overall contribution of ART to national births is known in many countries because of ART registries, very little is known about the contribution of OI/IUI treatment or the socio-demographic characteristics of the parents. Australia provides supportive public funding for all forms of MAR with no restrictions based on male or female age, and thus provides a unique setting to investigate the contribution of MAR to national births as well as the socio-demographic characteristics of parents across the different types of MAR births. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a novel population-based birth cohort study of 898 084 births using linked ART registry data and administrative data including birth registrations, medical services, pharmaceuticals, hospital admissions and deaths. Birth (a live or still birth of at least one baby of ≥400 g birthweight or ≥20 weeks' gestation) was the unit of analysis in this study. Multiple births were considered as one birth in our analysis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: This study included a total of 898 084 births (606 488 mothers) in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Australia 2009-2017. We calculated the prevalence of all categories of MAR-conceived births over the study period. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between parental characteristics (parent's age, parity, socio-economic status, maternal country of birth, remoteness of mother's dwelling, pre-existing medical conditions, smoking, etc.) and ART and OI/IUI births relative to naturally conceived births. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The proportion of MAR births increased from 5.1% of all births in 2009 to 6.7% in 2017, representing a 30% increase over the decade. The proportion of OI/IUI births remained stable at around 2% of all births, representing 32% of all MAR births. Over the study period, ART births conceived by frozen embryo-transfer increased nearly 3-fold. OI/IUI births conceived using clomiphene citrate decreased by 39%, while OI/IUI births conceived using letrozole increased 56-fold. Overall, there was a 55% increase over the study period in the number of ART-conceived births, rising to 56% of births to mothers aged 40 years and older. In 2017, almost one in six births (17.6%) to mothers aged 40 years and over were conceived using ART treatment. Conversely, the proportion of OI/IUI births was similar across different mother's age groups and remained stable over the study period. ART children, but not OI/IUI children, were more likely to have parents who were socio-economically advantaged compared to naturally conceived children. For example, compared to naturally conceived births, ART births were 16% less likely to be born to mothers who live in the disadvantaged neighbourhoods after accounting for other covariates (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 0.84 [95% CI: 0.81-0.88]). ART- or OI/IUI-conceived children were 25% less likely to be born to immigrant mothers than births after natural conception (aRR: 0.75 [0.74-0.77]). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The social inequalities that we observed between the parents of children born using ART and naturally conceived children may not directly reflect disparities in accessing fertility care for individuals seeking treatment. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: With the ubiquitous decline in fertility rates around the world and the increasing trend to delay childbearing, this population-based study enhances our understanding of the contribution of different types of MARs to population profiles among births in high-income countries. The parental socio-demographic characteristics of MAR-conceived children differ significantly from naturally conceived children and this highlights the importance of accounting for such differences in studies investigating the health and development of MAR-conceived children.

Manifestations such as opioid overdose events (OOEs) vary within and across communities and there is growing evidence that this variation is partially rooted in community-level social and economic conditions. The lack of high spatial resolution, timely data has hampered research into the associations between OOEs and social and physical environments. We explore the use of non-traditional, “found” geospatial data collected for other purposes as indicators of urban social-environmental conditions and their relationships with OOEs at the neighborhood level. We evaluate the use of Google Street View images and non-emergency “311” service requests, along with US Census data as indicators of social and physical conditions in community neighborhoods. We estimate negative binomial regression models with OOE data from first responders in Columbus, Ohio, USA between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017. Higher numbers of OOEs were positively associated with service request indicators of neighborhood physical and social disorder and street view imagery rated as boring or depressing based on a pre-trained random forest regression model. Perceived safety, wealth, and liveliness measures from the street view imagery were negatively associated with risk of an OOE. Age group 50–64 was positively associated with risk of an OOE but age 35–49 was negative. White population, percentage of individuals living in poverty, and percentage of vacant housing units were also found significantly positive however, median income and percentage of people with a bachelor's degree or higher were found negative. Our result shows neighborhood social and physical environment characteristics are associated with likelihood of OOEs. Our study adds to the scientific evidence that the opioid epidemic crisis is partially rooted in social inequality, distress and underinvestment. It also shows the previously underutilized data sources hold promise for providing insights into this complex problem to help inform the development of population-level interventions and harm reduction policies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Neighborhood context; Opioid overdose epidemic; Social and environment determinants of health; Street view images","Adult; Environment; Humans; Income; Middle Aged; Opiate Overdose; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Columbus [Ohio]; Ohio; United States; opiate; census; drug; machine learning; public health; spatial data; spatial resolution; World Wide Web; adult; Article; community; controlled study; disease association; distress syndrome; environment; female; groups by age; health service; housing; human; imagery; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; opiate addiction; opiate overdose; perception; physical environment; random forest; safety; social environment; social inequality; United States; demography; environment; epidemiology; income; middle aged; socioeconomics","","opiate, 53663-61-9, 8002-76-4, 8008-60-4","","","Office of Academic Affairs; Opioid Innovation Fund; Ohio State University, OSU, (2017H0220)","Funding text 1: The Opioid Innovation Fund, Office of Academic Affairs, The Ohio State University , partially supported this research.

Whereas the promise in explicitly linking geographical features to SES has been highlighted fairly clear in previous works, scholars hold an eclectic attitude in their outlook, given the absence of theoretical ground, the heavy reliance on nontransparent proprietary data sources and the relatively coarse resolution predictions. Drawing on a case study of Hangzhou metropolitan in China, this paper aims to address these problems by demonstrating a novel approach to neighborhood SES inference based on online housing advertisements. We first revisit the theoretical debates on the linkage between neighborhood SES and online housing advertisements. Then, the Naïve Bayes classifier is employed to semantically identify the topics from online housing advertisements and the associated sentiments are quantified using the lexicon-based approach. Following that, seven commonly used machine learning algorithms are compared and utilized to infer the fine-grained neighborhood SES at residential quarters scale based on the housing attributes and extracted topics from online housing advertisements. Results show that machine learning algorithms vary with predictive ability and the tree-based algorithms are much more powerful in inferring neighborhood SES. More specifically, we distinguish 8 reliable features which not only present relative high importance estimated by all the machine learning algorithms but also exhibit great robustness in inferring neighborhood SES and show promising potential to being applied for unraveling social inequalities. We also observe noteworthy spatial heterogeneity in neighborhood SES across the research site. The demonstrated approach not only enables the policymakers to take stock of deprived neighborhoods in a timely manner, but also lays firm ground for framing contextualized strategies of urban governance. This study is among the first attempts to bridge the theoretical interpretation of housing attributes with the proxy indicator -based approach for fine-grained neighborhood SES measurement. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Area deprivation; Machine learning; Neighborhood socioeconomic status; Online housing listings; Open data; Social inequalities","China; housing market; Internet; machine learning; metropolitan area; neighborhood; socioeconomic status; spatial resolution","","","","","Young Top-notch Talent Cultivation Program of Hubei Province; National Science Foundation, NSF, (41871165, 4201459); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2042021kf0204)","Funding support: This study is supported by the National Science Foundation (No. 4201459 ; 41871165 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 2042021kf0204 ) and the Young Top-notch Talent Cultivation Program of Hubei Province.

While technologies based on those advances can provide enormous social benefits, adoption of new technologies poses various risks. This article first reviews the co-evolution of AI and brain science and the benefits of brain-inspired AI in sustainability, healthcare, and scientific discoveries. We then consider possible risks from those technologies, including intentional abuse, autonomous weapons, cognitive enhancement by brain–computer interfaces, insidious effects of social media, inequity, and enfeeblement. We also discuss practical ways to bring ethical principles into practice. One proposal is to stop giving explicit goals to AI agents and to enable them to keep learning human preferences. Another is to learn from democratic mechanisms that evolved in human society to avoid over-consolidation of power. Finally, we emphasize the importance of open discussions not only by experts, but also including a diverse array of lay opinions. © 2022 The Author(s)","AI scientist; Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Governance; Human compatible AI; Neurotechnology","Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Social Change; Social Media; Economic and social effects; Ethical technology; Artificial intelligence scientist; Brain science; Co-evolution; Governance; Human compatible artificial intelligence; Intelligence science; Neurotechnology; Social benefits; Social impact; Technology-based; abuse; algorithm; amygdala; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; antitrust law; Article; artificial intelligence; climate change; clinical decision making; cognition; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; decision making; deep learning; electric conductivity; ethics; expert system; gene mutation; genomics; health care; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; learning; machine learning; mental disease; neuroscience; neurotechnology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pandemic; pollution; prediction; protein structure; reinforcement (psychology); risk; safety; social inequality; social media; spinal cord injury; technology; visual pattern recognition; X ray; social change; social media; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (16H06561, 16H06563, 16H06571, 16K21738); Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, OIST","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grants 16K21738 , 16H06561 , 16H06563 and 16H06571 , and research support of Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University to KD.

Research indicates that every $1 spent on well-designed early childhood interventions generates a return to society of $1.80-$17.07. A personalized, high quality, online Early Childhood Education course could benefit individual children, families and the community in various ways, such as improved cognitive development, high academic achievement, improved nutrition and health, and reduced social inequality. This paper discusses the challenges of big data collection and learning analytics in early childhood development areas and introduces integrated learning analytics and a personalized child development support framework. A joint project was undertaken by KBTC and Sesame Workshop to design and create an interactive multimedia learning course and use learning analytics platforms to provide digitalized personal assessment and tracking for a group of children aged 3-6 in China. The project uses the award-winning educational TV program Sesame Street together with cloud computing, mobile internet and big data analysis technologies to provide a personalized digital learning experience, progress tracking and follow-up adaptive learning recommendations. In order to present an overview of the large quantity of data in support of better learning analytics and personalized learning, a cross country, interdisciplinary collaboration framework is recommended. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Frankfurt am Main 2016.

It explores different ways of producing knowledge, thus showing alternatives to the current dominant paradigm which is based on turning knowledge produced collectively into intangible assets, owned by a few leading corporations. It discusses a paradox: knowledge creation by government-sponsored research infrastructures (RI) or by non-profit institutions, including universities, is increasingly appearing in the form of “open science” - ideas and data are widely available in the public domain. However, such knowledge is privatised downstream by new oligopolies. These oligopolies, such as the Tech Giants, are protected by legislation on intellectual property rights that restricts further access to knowledge. This process contributes to increasing social inequality. The book suggests alternative policy options to counteract this process: the design of new players with a public mission and a coalition of governments as patient investors for the long-term benefit not just of the citizens of one jurisdiction but for creating global public goods. Proposals are presented for launching European R&D infrastructures related to three major long-term challenges: health risks, climate change and Big Data governance. These knowledge-intensive enterprises should offer innovation as a public good, for example in new biomedical fields underinvested by private firms, disruptive ‘green’ technologies, digital platforms based on transparent users’ ownership of data. Offering a balanced combination of theories and practical applications including interesting case studies, the book will appeal to students, scholars and researchers of public economics and governance. It will also find an audience among policymakers, practitioners and government officials. © 2024 Massimo Florio.","","","","","","","","","Abrignani S., La necessità di realizzare un vaccino per tutti i coronavirus, in «Corriere della Sera», (2020); Angelis A., Alonso C.S., Kyriopoulos I., Mossialos E., Funding sources of therapeutic and vaccine clinical trials for COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 indica-tions, 2020-2021, JAMA Network Open, 5, 8, (2022); Archibugi D., Filippetti A., The handbook of global science, tech-nology, and innovation, (2015); Arute F., Arya K., Babbush R., Et al., Quantum supremacy using a program-mable superconducting processor, Nature, 574, 7779, pp. 505-510, (2019); Arrow K.J., The economics of information: An exposition, Empirica, 23, 2, pp. 119-128, (1996); Atkinson A.B., Inequality.

Drawing on observations and interviews conducted within the Los Angeles Police Department, I offer an empirical account of how the adoption of big data analytics does—and does not—transform police surveillance practices. I argue that the adoption of big data analytics facilitates amplifications of prior surveillance practices and fundamental transformations in surveillance activities. First, discretionary assessments of risk are supplemented and quantified using risk scores. Second, data are used for predictive, rather than reactive or explanatory, purposes. Third, the proliferation of automatic alert systems makes it possible to systematically surveil an unprecedentedly large number of people. Fourth, the threshold for inclusion in law enforcement databases is lower, now including individuals who have not had direct police contact. Fifth, previously separate data systems have merged, facilitating the spread of surveillance into a wide range of institutions. Based on these findings, I develop a theoretical model of big data surveillance that can be applied to institutional domains beyond the criminal justice system. Finally, I highlight the social consequences of big data surveillance for law and social inequality. © 2021, Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Crime; Ethnography; Inequality; Law; Predictive algorithms","adoption; adult; algorithm; article; big data; California; cell proliferation; crime; criminal justice; data system; drawing; ethnography; female; human; human experiment; interview; law enforcement; male; police; risk assessment","","","","","","","Angwin J., Dragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security, and Freedom in a World of Relentless Surveillance, (2014); Ball K., Webster F., The Intensification of Surveillance.

Studies have examined the gendered nature of travel from the perspective of a mismatch between women’s needs and availability of transport services, including fragmentized activity space, low affordability, and sensitization to safety. However, minimal attention has been given to the gender gap in the age of ride-hailing. Thus, this paper examines the nexus between gender and ride-hailing usage from the aspect of activity space and affordability. Two key questions are explored: (a) Are women dependent on ride-hailing? (b) If ride-hailing serves women differentially, how does this gender difference in the use of ride-hailing services occur? An innovative integration of big data and a travel survey is developed to examine such questions in Chengdu, China. Survey results and modelling analysis indicate that gender gaps in mobility is relatively mitigated by ride-hailing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Activity space; Gender gap; Platform-based mobility service; Social inequality; Transport equity","","","","","","2020 Guangdong New Innovative Strategic Research Fund; Guangdong; Joint Programming Initiative; Peking University-Lincoln Institute Center for Urban Development and Land Policy, (DS04-20211001-QS); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71961137003); University of Hong Kong, HKU; Science and Technology Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, (2020B1212030009)","Acknowledgements This study received institutional ethics approval from the University of Hong Kong, Reference HREC: EA210312).

Differences between instrumental and critical approaches in the digital divide literature are considered to highlight the limitations of the former approaches and the ways these are reflected in European policy. What we know about the relationship between technological innovation and society and its consequences for economic and social inequality is summarised and emerging expressions of inequality between humans and their digital machines are discussed. With computational models, algorithms and machine learning becoming more pervasive, it is argued that human beings are at risk of losing the ability to control the digitally mediated environment. Policy measures create incentives for small shifts in corporate digital platform strategy that amount to tinkering with the overall direction of technological innovation. The article emphasises the need for an inclusive dialogue to reveal potential alternative directions that might take better account of what people value in their digitally mediated lives. © 2017 EURICOM.","Algorithms;

In vascular surgery, this technology has the ability to diagnose disease, predict disease outcomes, and assist with image-guided surgery. As we enter an era of rapid change, it is critical to evaluate the ethical concerns of AI, particularly as it may impact patient safety and privacy. This is particularly important to discuss in the early stages of AI, as technology frequently outpaces the policies and ethical guidelines regulating it. Issues at the forefront include patient privacy and confidentiality, protection of patient autonomy and informed consent, accuracy and applicability of this technology, and propagation of health care disparities. Vascular surgeons should be equipped to work with AI, as well as discuss its novel risks to patient safety and privacy. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Patient privacy; Patient safety; Vascular surgery","Artificial Intelligence; Health Facilities; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Patient Safety; Privacy; accuracy; artificial intelligence; confidentiality; health care disparity; human; informed consent; patient autonomy; patient safety; personalized medicine; policy; practice guideline; privacy; Review; social inequality; vascular surgeon; artificial intelligence; health care facility","","","","","","","Zippel C., Bohnet-Joschko S., Rise of clinical studies in the field of machine learning: a review of data registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, Int J Environ Res Public Health, 18, (2021); (2023); Fischer U.M., Shireman P.K., Lin J.C., Current applications of artificial intelligence in vascular surgery, Semin Vasc Surg, 34, pp. 268-271, (2021); Krittanawong C., Johnson K.W., Choi E., Et al., Artificial intelligence and cardiovascular genetics, Life (Basel), 12, (2022); Stella A., The way we were: technology will change the profession of vascular surgery, Transl Med UniSa, 21, pp. 52-58, (2020); Chan H.-P., Samala R.K., Hadjiiski L.M., Et al., Deep learning in medical image analysis, Adv Exp Med Biol, 1213, pp. 3-21, (2020); Sajda P., Machine learning for detection and diagnosis of disease, Annu Rev Biomed Eng, 8, pp. 537-565, (2006); Bastanlar Y., Zuysal M., Introduction to machine learning, Methods Mol Biol, 1107, pp. 105-128, (2014); Li B., Feridooni T., Cuen-Ojeda C., Et al., Machine learning in vascular surgery: a systematic review and critical appraisal, NPJ Digit Med, 5, (2022); Lee R., Jarchi D., Perera R., Et al., Applied machine learning for the prediction of growth of abdominal aortic aneurysm in humans, EJVES Short Rep, 39, pp. 24-28, (2018); Ross E.G., Shah N.H., Dalman R.L., Et al., The use of machine learning for the identification of peripheral artery disease and future mortality risk, J Vasc Surg, 64, (2016); Kappe K.O., Smorenburg S.P.M., Hoksbergen A.W.J., Et al.; (2021); Rigby M.J., Ethical dimensions of using artificial intelligence in health care, AMA J Ethics, 21, pp. 121-124, (2019); Schiff D., Borenstein J., How should clinicians communicate with patients about the roles of artificially intelligent team members?, AMA J Ethics, 21, 2, pp. E138-E145, (2019); Chen I., Szolovits P., Ghassemi M., Can AI help reduce disparities in general medical and mental health care?, AMA J Ethics, 21, 2, pp. E167-E179, (2019); Azencott C., Machine learning and genomics: precision medicine versus patient privacy, Philos Trans Ser A Math Phys Eng Sci, 376, 2128, (2018); (2023); (2023); (2021); (2021); Rathee A., Data breaches in healthcare: a case study, Cybernomics, 2, 2, pp. 25-29, (2020); Khalid N., Qayyum A., Bilal M., Et al., Privacy-preserving artificial intelligence in healthcare: techniques and applications, Comput Biol Med, 158, (2023); Al-Kuwari S., Privacy-preserving AI in healthcare, Multiple Perspectives on Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, pp. 65-77, (2021); Price W.N., Big data and black-box medical algorithms, Sci Transl Med, 10, 471, (2018); Hashimoto D.A., Rosman G., Rus D., Et al., Artificial intelligence in surgery: promises and perils, Ann Surg, 268, pp. 70-76, (2018); Black-box medicine, Harvard J Law Technol, 28, pp. 419-467, (2015); Mehta N., Devarakonda M.V., Machine learning, natural language programming, and electronic health records: the next step in the artificial intelligence journey?, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 141, pp. 2019-2021, (2018); Cutillo C.M., Sharma K.R., Foschini L., Et al., Machine intelligence in healthcare-perspectives on trustworthiness, explainability, usability, and transparency, NPJ Digit Med, 3, (2020); CPT Professional 2020, (2019); Johnson E.K., Nelson C.P.; Tomihama R., Camara J., Kiang S., Machine learning analysis of confounding variables of a convolutional neural network specific for abdominal aortic aneurysms, J Vasc Surg, 4, (2023); Zou J., Schiebinger L., AI can be sexist and racist—it's time to make it fair, Nature, 559, 7714, pp. 324-326, (2018); Char D.S., Shah N.H., Magnus D., Implementing machine learning in health care–addressing ethical challenges, N Engl J Med, 378, pp. 981-983, (2018); Ghassemi M., Naumann T., Schulam P., Et al., (2018)","J.J.

We endorse many of her suggestions to connect global labour and economic history and to regard labour relations not only as a dependent variable. In fact, as the examples from various Collab workshops and publications show, some of these ideas are already being put into practice. These examples also show that if we seriously want to combine global labour and economic history data and join the debate on the growth (or decrease) in social inequality, workers' individual and collective agency must be taken on board. Finally, we argue that global labour and economic historians can benefit most from each other's disciplines by truly working together in collaborative projects, developing new theories, perhaps less grand than those with which economic historians attract so much attention, but more profound. © Internationaal Instituut voor Sociale Geschiedenis 2017.","","","","","","","","","Hofmeester K., Lucassen J., Ribeiro Da Silva F., No Global Labor HistoryWithout Africa: Reciprocal Comparison and beyond, Introduction to the Special Section ""labor History in Africa"" of History in Africa, 41, pp. 249-276, (2014); Hofmeester K., Lucassen J., Lucassen L., Stapel R., Zijdeman R., The Global Collaboratory on the History of Labour Relations, 1500-2000: Background, Set-Up, Taxonomy and Applications, (2015); Lucassen L., Working Together: New Directions in Global Labour History, Journal of Global History, 11, 1, pp. 66-87, (2016); Tilly C., Tilly C., Work under Capitalism, (1998); Austin G., Reciprocal Comparison and AfricanHistory: Tackling Conceptual Eurocentrism in the Study of Africa's Economic Past, African Studies Review, 50, 3, pp. 1-28, (2007); Mendiola F., The Role of Unfree Labour in Capitalist Development: Spain and its Empire, Nineteenth to the Twenty-First Centuries, International Review of Social History, 61, SI24, pp. 187-211, (2016); Ruggles S., Demographic Transition, Marriage Patterns, and Labor Force Change, The Impact of Family and Demography on Labour Relations Worldwide"", Held at the IISH, (2014); Romano R.B., Extractive Economy and Institutions?

Physical closeness to family post-disaster plays a critical role in mental healing and societal sustainability. Nonetheless, little is known about whether and how family colocation alters after a disaster, a topic of immense importance to a post-disaster society. We analyze 1 billion records of population-scale, granular, individual-level mobile location data to quantify family colocation, and examine the magnitude, dynamics, and socioeconomic heterogeneity of the shift in family colocation from the pre- to post-disaster period. Leveraging Hurricane Florence as a natural experiment, and Geographic Information System (GIS), machine learning, and statistical methods to investigate the shift across the landfall (treated) city of Wilmington, three partially treated cites on the hurricane’s path, and two control cities off the path, we uncover dramatic (18.9%), widespread (even among the partially treated cities), and enduring (over at least 3 months) escalations in family colocation. These findings reveal the powerful psychological and behavioral impacts of the disaster upon the broader populations, and simultaneously remarkable human resilience via behavioral adaptations during disastrous times. Importantly, the disaster created a gap across socioeconomic groups nonexistent beforehand, with the disadvantaged displaying weaker lifts in family colocation. This sheds important lights on policy making and policy communication to promote sustainable family colocation, healthy coping strategies against traumatic experiences, social parity, and societal recovery.

The magnitude that underlying factors—such as social inequalities—contribute to these symptoms is unknown. We sought to identify exposures that explain racial/ethnic differences in clinically significant depressive symptomology among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: Data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a prospective cohort study, were used to examine clinically significant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score ≥ 20) among non-Latinx White, non-Latinx Black, and Latinx MSM. We included 44,823 person-visits by 1729 MSM seen in the study sites of Baltimore/Washington, DC; Chicago; Pittsburgh/Columbus; and Los Angeles from 2000 to 2017. Regression models estimated the percentage of depressive symptom risk explained by social, treatment, and health-related variables related to race/ethnicity. Machine-learning methods were used to predict the impact of mitigating differences in determinants of depressive symptoms by race/ethnicity. Results: At the most recent non-missing MACS visit, 16% of non-Latinx White MSM reported clinically significant depressive symptoms, compared to 22% of non-Latinx Black and 25% of Latinx men. We found that income and social-environmental stress were the largest contributors to racial/ethnic disparities in risk for depressive symptoms. Similarly, setting the prevalence of these two exposures to be equal across racial/ethnic groups was estimated to be most effective at reducing levels of clinically significant depressive symptoms.

Low accessibility may cause compromise on living conditions, low economic growth, high unemployment, social seclusion, and long-term social inequalities. In developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, surveys fail to keep up with the pace of rapid urbanization. Additionally, numerous location-based data sets, including mobile phone location data and Google Maps travel time, enable near-real-time observations of actively changing mobility dynamics. In this study, we use these novel data sets to assess various facets of accessibility and corresponding poverty-based inequalities within the Greater Maputo region in Mozambique. A data-based approach is seldom used in the Sub-Saharan African context. Consistent poverty-based inequalities in access to opportunities by driving, transit, and walking are observed. The transit system was ascertained to be more inefficient in the poorer regions. The richer regions witnessed most decreased access to opportunities because of high congestion. People living in the poorest regions were observed to travel much longer distances to access facilities than did those living in the richest regions. These differences were particularly significant for essential services of education, healthcare, and employment. These results can help urban planners and policymakers identify disadvantaged communities and develop policies to ameliorate the conditions. This assists in measuring the progress of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and investigating areas of concern. Moreover, this study shows the applicability of various data sets and methods in a data-deprived scenario in Africa, and motivates more scholars and practitioners to partake in this technology leapfrogging. © National Academy of Sciences.","big data analytics; data and data science; data for decision-making; policy and organization; sustainability and resilience; transportation and society; transportation in the developing countries","Behavioral research; Big data; Developing countries; Economics; Sustainable development; Travel time; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Data and data science; Data for decision-making; Data set; Decisions makings; Policy and organization; Sustainability and resilience; Transportation and society; Transportation in the developing country; Decision making","","","","","","","Barofsky J., Siba E., Grabinsky J., Can Rapid Urbanization in Africa Reduce Poverty?

Thus, alternative forms of consent have been suggested, based on a variety of ethical background assumptions. This article identifies five main ethical perspectives at stake. Even though Tiered Consent, Dynamic Consent and Meta Consent are designed to the demands of the self-determination perspective as well as the perspective of research as a public good, they are still also criticized from both perspectives. In addition, criticisms based on concerns of justice, participation and democratic deliberation, and relational concerns have been levelled at each of the models. As all of these perspectives have valid points to make, the task at hand lies in balancing these ethical perspectives. What constitutes an adequate balancing depends on contextual factors. These factors include digital infrastructure and digital literacy, data safety regulation, good scientific and clinical practice, transparent debates on ethically relevant features of research, social inequalities, anti-discrimination laws and practices, trust in health care institutions and recognition of patient preferences, and consensus on unethical research. We argue that the role of context in determining acceptable models of consent puts the ethical importance of models of consent into perspective. Since altering contextual factors can help to live up to the ethical concerns at stake in debates about models of consent, opting for such a shift of focus comes without ethical loss. © 2022, The Author(s).","Big data; Biobank; Broad consent; Ethics; Informed consent; Research ethics","Biomedical Research; Humans; Informed Consent; Morals; Trust; adult; article; big data; biobank; clinical practice; consensus; drug safety; ethics; health data; human; informed consent; internet literacy; justice; medical research; patient preference; research ethics; trust; morality","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01GP1902A)","The research presented in this paper was supported by the German Ministry of Education and Research; grant number 01GP1902A.

This article contributes to this literature by exploring the use of big data under Australia and Aotearoa/New Zealand's social investment approaches. Both seek to replace social policy spending with “investment” expected to produce future fiscal returns; in the words of a former Aotearoa/New Zealand Prime Minister, they aim to do “more with less”. We argue that big data often provides a poor evidence base for social investment and can, instead, be better understood as part of a panoptic toolkit for poverty governance, mediating continuous surveillance, examination and normalisation of the body politic by enabling the discursive (re)construction of people's identities and subjectivities.

Health systems face growing public pressure to collect data on patient “social factors,” and advocates and public officials seek to leverage such data sources as a means of system transformation. Despite the promise of this “data-driven” strategy, there is little empirical work that examines big data in action directly within the sites of care expected to transform. In this article, I present a case study on one such initiative, focusing on a large public safety-net health system’s initiation of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection within the clinical setting. Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with providers, staff, and administrators, I highlight three main challenges that elude big data’s grasp on inequality: (1) provider and staff’s limited understanding of the social significance of data collection; (2) patient perception of the cultural insensitivity of data items; and (3) clinic need to balance data requests with competing priorities within a constrained time window. These issues reflect structural challenges within safety-net care that big data alone are unable to address in advancing social justice. I discuss these findings by considering the present data-driven strategy alongside two complementary courses of action: diversifying the health professions workforce and clinical education reform. To truly advance justice, we need more than “just data”: we need to confront the fundamental conditions of social inequality. © The Author(s) 2020.","Big data analytics; electronic health records; gender and sexual minority health; health disparities; health equity; quantification; safety-net; United States","","","","","","University of California, San Francisco, UCSF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by UCSF Departments of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Anthropology, History, and Social Medicine.

More extreme urban heat island (UHI) effects are not distributed equally, and often impact socioeconomically vulnerable populations the most. This study aims to quantify how land surface temperature (LST) changes with increasing green vegetation landscapes, identify disparities in urban warming exposure, and provide a method for developing evidence-based mitigation options. ECOSTRESS LST products, detailed land use and land cover (LULC) classes, and socioeconomic variables were used to facilitate the analysis. We examined the relationship between LST and the fractions of LULC and socioeconomic factors in the city of Phoenix, Arizona. A machine learning approach (Random Forest) was used to model LST changes by taking the LULC fractions (scenario-based approaches) as the explanatory variables. We found that vegetation features—trees, grass, and shrubs—were the most important factors mitigating UHI effects during the summer daytime. Trees tended to lower surface temperature more effectively, whereas we observed elevated daytime LST most often near roads. Meanwhile, higher summer daytime temperatures were observed on land with unmanaged soil compared to the built environment. We found that affluent neighborhoods experienced lower temperatures, while low-income communities experienced higher temperatures. Scenario analyses suggest that replacing 50% of unmanaged soil with trees could reduce average summer daytime temperatures by 1.97°C if the intervention was implemented across all of Phoenix and by 1.43°C if implemented within the urban core only. We suggest that native trees requiring little to no additional water other than rainfall should be considered. We quantify mitigation options for urban warming effect under vegetation management interventions, and our results provide some vital insight into existing disparities in UHI impacts. Future UHI mitigation strategies seriously need to consider low-income communities to improve environmental justice. These can be used to guide the development of sustainable and equitable policies for vegetation management to mitigate heat exposure impacts on communities.

With the acceleration of urbanization and changes in traffic networks, it remains unclear whether changes in the distribution of UGSs can satisfy the needs of all inhabitants and offer equal services to inhabitants from different socioeconomic backgrounds. This study addresses this issue by analyzing dynamic changes in UGS accessibility in 2012, 2016, and 2020 for inhabitants of the central urban area of Fuzhou in China at the community level. The study introduces multiple transportation modes for an accessibility estimation based on a framework using the two-step floating catchment area method and examines the dynamic changes in community deprivation of UGS accessibility using Kernel regularized least squares, a machine learning algorithm. The results demonstrate that spatial disparities of UGS accessibility exist among the multi-transport modes and vary with time. Communities with high accessibility to UGSs by walking are scattered around the urban area; for accessibility by cycling, the high accessibility regions expand and surround the regions with low accessibility in the core urban areas, forming a semi-enclosed spatial pattern. However, the core urban spatial orientation of UGS accessibility by public transit demonstrates a reverse trend to the above two modes. The spatial pattern of UGS accessibility also varies over time, and the growth rate of accessibility slightly declined during the study period. Furthermore, the increase in UGS accessibility tended to slow from 2016–2020 compared with 2012–2016, and the trend toward equality was also erratic. The degree of deprivation for communities first weakened and was then aggravated, corresponding to the slowdown in the growth rate of accessibility, leading to the persistence existence of social inequality. Moreover, significant deprivation mainly exists among less educated people or those using the cycling and integrated travel modes. Although public transport is developing, deprived communities, such as communities with large proportion of older people, have experienced a decline in access to UGSs by public transport. Based on these findings, the study proposes a policy framework for the balanced distribution of UGSs as part of urbanization. © Copyright © 2021 Cheng, Liao and Zhu.","deprivation; distribution disparity; dynamic changes; multiple transportation modes; urban green spaces","Aged; Catchment Area, Health; Humans; Parks, Recreational; Quality of Life; Transportation; Urbanization; aged; human; quality of life; recreational park; traffic and transport; urbanization","","","","","","","The Standard of Urban Green Space Classification: CJJ/T 85-−2017, (2017); Qiu G.Y., Zou Z.D., Li X.Z., Li H.Y., Guo Q.P., Yan C.H., Et al., Experimental studies on the effects of green space and evapotranspiration on urban heat island in a subtropical megacity in China, Habitat Int, 68, pp. 30-42, (2017); Escobedo F.J., Kroeger T., Wagner J.E., Urban forests and pollution mitigation: analyzing ecosystem services and disservices, Environ Pollut, 159, pp. 2078-2087, (2011); Sugiyama T., Leslie E., Giles-Corti B., Owen N., Associations of neighbourhood greenness with physical and mental health: do walking, social coherence and local social interaction explain the relationships?, J Epidemiol Commun H, 62, (2008); Elmqvist T., Fragkias M., Goodness J., Guneralp B., Marcotullio P.J., Mcdonald R.I., Et al., Urbanization, Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services: Challenges and Opportunities, (2013); Haase D., Frantzeskaki N., Elmqvist T., Ecosystem services in urban landscapes: practical applications and governance implications, Ambio, 43, pp. 407-412, (2014); van D.B.M., van P.M., van K.I., Andrusaityte S., Balseviciene B., Cirach M., Et al., Visiting green space is associated with mental health and vitality: a cross-sectional study in four european cities, Health Place, 38, pp. 8-15, (2016); Veitch J., Abbott G., Kaczynski A.T., Stanis S.A.W., Besenyi G.M., Lamb K.E., Park availability and physical activity, TV time, and overweight and obesity among women: findings from Australia and the United States, Health Place, 38, pp. 96-102, (2016); Krellenberg K., Welz J., Reyes-Packe S., Urban green areas and their potential for social interaction A case study of a socio-economically mixed neighbourhood in Santiago de Chile, Habitat Int, 44, pp. 11-21, (2014); Ekkel E.D., de V.S., Nearby green space and human health: evaluating accessibility metrics, Landsc Urban Plan, 157, pp. 214-220, (2017); Bricker K.S., Hendricks W.W., Aschenbrenner C.A., Californians' perceptions of the influence of parks and recreation on quality of life, J Park Recreation Adm, 34, pp. 64-82, (2016); Aram F., Solgi E., Holden G., The role of green spaces in increasing social interactions in neighborhoods with periodic markets, Habitat Int, 84, pp. 24-32, (2019); Ze L., Feng M., Wensheng Z., Qiang L., Jianxi H., Xianlong Z., Accessibility assessment of urban green space: a quantitative perspective, 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, (2008); Tan P.Y., Samsudin R., Effects of spatial scale on assessment of spatial equity of urban park provision, Landsc Urban Plan, 158, pp. 139-154, (2017); Ren Z., Du Y., He X., Pu R., Zheng H., Hu H., Spatiotemporal pattern of urban forest leaf area index in response to rapid urbanization and urban greening, J Forestry Res, 29, pp. 785-796, (2018); Byomkesh T., Nakagoshi N., Dewan A.M., Urbanization and green space dynamics in Greater Dhaka, Bangladesh, Landsc Ecol Eng, 8, pp. 45-58, (2012); Xu M., Xin J., Su S., Weng M., Cai Z., Social inequalities of park accessibility in Shenzhen, China: the role of park quality, transport modes, and hierarchical socioeconomic characteristics, J Transp Geogr, 62, pp. 38-50, (2017); Zhou X.L., Wang Y.C., Spatial-temporal dynamics of urban green space in response to rapid urbanization and greening policies, Landsc Urban Plan, 100, pp. 268-277, (2011); Xiao Y., Wang Z., Li Z., Tang Z., An assessment of urban park access in Shanghai—implications for the social equity in urban China, Landsc Urban Plan, 157, pp. 383-393, (2017); Wei F., Greener urbanization?

The aim of this paper is to understand spatial segregation in the city of São Paulo (a city known by its social inequality and urban poverty) by scraping social media tags of emotions. We compared aspects that suggest socio-spatial inequalities: urban poor versus feelings of love and hate, versus feelings of joy and fear and the social vulnerability index as background. Three issues are considered in this research: the emergence of urban space big data, digital inclusion, and architects and urbanists' access to big data.

As the prevalence of heart failure increases, multidisciplinary care is essential to provide comprehensive care to individuals. Recent Findings: The challenges of implementing an effective multidisciplinary care team can be daunting. Effective multidisciplinary care begins at the initial diagnosis of heart failure. The transition of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting is critically important. The use of home visits, case management, and multidisciplinary clinics has been shown to decrease mortality and heart failure hospitalizations, and major society guidelines endorse multidisciplinary care for heart failure patients. Summary: Expanding heart failure care beyond cardiology entails incorporating primary care, advanced practice providers, and other disciplines. Patient education and self-management are fundamental to multidisciplinary care, as is a holistic approach to effectively address comorbid conditions. Ongoing challenges include navigating social disparities within heart failure care and limiting the economic burden of the disease. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cardiac rehabilitation;

Due to their power, size, and scope, manufacturing multinational enterprises (MNEs) are considered by other organizations as best practice references. If there is already evidence that digitalization favours environmental sustainability, social sustainability still needs to be explored. This study aims to analyze the contribution of the implementation of digital technologies in promoting environmental and social sustainability in European manufacturing MNEs using the Resource-Based View (RBV). A research model was formulated comprising five digital technologies (Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Robotics, Big Data Analytics, and Blockchain) and sustainable environmental and social practices. To test the model, the Partial Least Squares method was applied to a sample of 764 European manufacturing MNEs. The results show that European MNEs still have a low implementation of digital technologies in their business models. Digital technologies positively contribute to achieving these companies' environmental and social sustainability. However, the contributions of implementing each digital technology to environmental and social sustainability are not equal, allowing investment prioritization by manufacturing MNEs according to the strategically defined return. This study contributes to the evolution of RBV considering digital technology as a strategic resource. It focuses on assessing the contribution of five digital technologies to achieving environmental and social sustainability and demonstrates the importance of the digital transition towards greener manufacturing production in environmental and social terms. It also suggests practices managers and policymakers can implement to accelerate digitalization and achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023 The Authors","Digital technologies; Digitalization; Environmental and social sustainability; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing MNEs; Resource-based view","Cloud analytics; Data Analytics; Environmental technology; Least squares approximations; Sustainable development; Digital technologies; Digitalization; Environmental and social sustainability; European manufacturing; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing multinational enterprise; Multinational enterprise; Resource-based view; Technology industry; Traditional systems; Industry 4.0","","","","","Information technology","Recent studies show that companies aiming to achieve environmental sustainability must implement Industry 4.0 technologies (Jayashree et al., 2022; Kamble et al., 2018; Müller et al., 2018). Jayashree et al. (2021) study the relationship between implementing Industry 4.0 technologies and the objectives for environmental sustainability. The authors conclude that the characteristics of technological innovation have a positive effect on the implementation of Industry 4.0 and on the objectives of environmental sustainability. Jayashree et al. (2022) analyze the dynamics in adopting Industry 4.0 to achieve environmental sustainability. The authors state that management leadership, external support, teamwork, and Information technology (IT) resources are relevant to implement Industry 4.0 and to achieve environmental sustainability. Satyro et al. (2022) identify the challenges and benefits of implementing Industry 4.0, analyzing potential social impacts. The authors conclude that Industry 4.0 has increased companies' competitiveness and improved production lines' quality. However, they identified difficulties in changing the organizational culture due to the difficulty in hiring/training human resources in digital technologies and the high investments that need to be made. The authors also state that environmental sustainability is considered secondary in formulating companies' strategies, and the social dimension is little considered. Grybauskas et al. (2022), through a systematic review of academic and gray literature, analyze the social implications of Industry 4.0. The authors conclude that the academic literature indicates that Industry 4.0 needs internal mechanisms to develop ways to achieve social sustainability. The authors also state that Industry 4.0 does not necessarily extend the corporation's social responsibility to the entire value chain. Furthermore, in the Industry 4.0 scenario, the delivery of social development values has never been among the main objectives of corporate governance (Grybauskas et al., 2022).","Adomako S., Amankwah-Amoah J., Danso A., Konadu R., Owusu-Agyei S., Environmental sustainability orientation and performance of family and nonfamily firms, Bus.

Attempting to answer these questions involves large datasets of varied heterogeneous data suggesting that Big Data approaches could be then particularly relevant to the study of social inequalities in health. Nevertheless, real challenges have to be addressed in order to make the best use of the development of Big Data in health for the benefit of all. The main purpose of this perspective is to discuss some of these challenges, in particular: (i) the perimeter and the particularity of Big Data in health, which must be broader than a vision centerd solely on care, the individual and his or her biological characteristics; (ii) the need for clarification regarding the notion of data, the validity of data and the question of causal inference for various actors involved in health, such data as researchers, health professionals and the civilian population; (iii) the need for regulation and control of data and their uses by public authorities for the common good and the fight against social inequalities in health. To face these issues, it seems essential to integrate different approaches into a close dialog, integrating methodological, societal, and ethical issues. This question cannot escape an interdisciplinary approach, including users or patients. © Copyright © 2018 Delpierre and Kelly-Irving.","Big data; embodiment; global health; health equity; health policy; social determinants of health","","","","","","","","Gallo V., Mackenbach J.P., Ezzati M., Menvielle G., Kunst A.E., Rohrmann S., Et al., Social inequalities and mortality in Europe–results from a large multi-national cohort, PLoS ONE, 7, (2012); Hertzman C., The biological embedding of early experience and its effects on health in adulthood, Ann N Y Acad Sci, 896, pp. 85-95, (1999); Durkheim E., Les règles de la méthode sociologique, (1937); Kuh D., Ben-Shlomo Y., Lynch J., Hallqvist J., Power C., Life course epidemiology, J Epidemiol Commun Health, 57, pp. 778-783, (2003); Krieger N., Embodiment: a conceptual glossary for epidemiology, J Epidemiol Commun Health, 59, pp. 350-355, (2005); Hertzman C., Putting the concept of biological embedding in historical perspective, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 109, pp. 17160-17167, (2012); Barker D.J., Osmond C., Infant mortality, childhood nutrition, and ischaemic heart disease in England and Wales, 1, pp. 1077-1081, (1986); Constitution of the World Health Organization; Overby C.L., Tarczy-Hornoch P., Personalized medicine: challenges and opportunities for translational bioinformatics, Per Med, 10, pp. 453-462, (2013); Panahiazar M., Taslimitehrani V., Jadhav A., Pathak J., Empowering personalized medicine with big data and semantic web technology: promises, challenges, and use cases, Proc IEEE Int Conf Big Data, 2014, pp. 790-795, (2014); Mentis A.A., Pantelidi K., Dardiotis E., Hadjigeorgiou G.M., Petinaki E., Precision medicine and global health: the good, the bad, and the ugly, Front Med, 5, (2018); McCue M.E., McCoy A.M., The scope of big data in one medicine: unprecedented opportunities and challenges, Front Vet Sci, 4, (2017); Marrast P., Zarate P., Annotation management: a group decision support system for nurse tasks, J Decis Syst, 24, pp. 105-116, (2015); Saracci R., Epidemiology in wonderland: big data and precision medicine, Eur J Epidemiol, 33, pp. 245-257, (2018); Castelvecchi D., Can we open the black box of AI?, Nature, 538, pp. 20-23, (2016); Anderson C.T., (2008); Marmot M., Fair Society, Healthy Lives: The Marmot Review, (2010); Pasquale F., The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information, (2015)","C.

However, there is little data summarizing current content exchange in this context. Objective: To inform ethical dementia research engagement on social media, we characterized current practices by analyzing public social media posts. Methods: We retrieved Facebook (2-year period, N = 7,896) and Twitter (1-year period, N = 9,323) posts containing dementia research-related keywords using manual and machine learning-based search strategies. We performed qualitative and quantitative content and sentiment analyses on random samples (10%) of the posts. Results: Top Facebook users were advocacy (45%) and health organizations (25%). On Twitter, academics/researchers were the largest user group. Prevention was the most frequently coded theme (Facebook 30%; Twitter 26%), followed by treatment (Facebook 15%; Twitter 18%). Diagnostics had the highest Facebook engagement. Sharing knowledge was the primary form of content exchange (Facebook 63%; Twitter 80%). Most shared journal articles were peer-reviewed and open access. Emotional tone was overall more positive on Facebook. Justice was a prominent ethics topic regarding inequalities related to identity and intersecting modes of marginalization in dementia research. Conclusion: The findings indicate the importance of social media as an engagement tool of current topics in health research and reveal areas of potential for increased engagement. These data can inform consensus-based best practices for ethical social media application in dementia research.  © 2022 - The authors.

Discussions of bias in AI cover much of the same conceptual terrain that sociologists studying inequality have long understood using more specific terms and theories. Concerns over reproducing societal bias should be informed by an understanding of the ways that inequality is continually reproduced in society—processes that AI systems are either complicit in, or can be designed to disrupt and counter. The contrast presented here is between conservative and radical approaches to AI, with conservatism referring to dominant tendencies that reproduce and strengthen the status quo, while radical approaches work to disrupt systemic forms of inequality. The limitations of a conservative approach to racial bias are discussed through the specific example of biased criminal risk assessments and Indigenous overrepresentation in Canada’s criminal justice system. This illustrates the dangers of treating racial bias as a generalizable problem and equality as a generalizable solution, emphasizing the importance of considering inequality in context. Societal issues can no longer be out of scope for AI and machine learning, given the impact of these systems on human lives. This requires engagement with a growing body of critical AI scholarship that goes beyond biased data to analyze structured ways of perpetuating inequality, opening up the possibility for interdisciplinary engagement and radical alternatives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","Bias; Colonialism; Fairness; Inequality; Politics; Sociology","Cell proliferation; Crime; Risk assessment; Artificial intelligence systems; Conservative approaches; Criminal justice system; Growing bodies; In contexts; Social inequalities; Social theory; Societal issues; Artificial intelligence","","","","","University of British Columbia, UBC","Research for this article was supported by funding from the University of British Columbia.

To achieve a large and representative sample for this investigation of the different impacts of the built environment on travel mobility of various income and migrant groups, we have utilized big data from mobile phones for over 10 million users in Shenzhen, China. Travel mobility was measured by non-commute travel frequency and activity space. Our descriptive analysis demonstrates lower-income groups and migrant workers have lower levels of travel mobility than higher-income groups and non-migrant workers. The results produced by our linear regression models also reveal a significant travel mobility gap between different income and migration groups. That gap appears to be positively impacted by job density and bus stop distance and negatively impacted by residential density and metro station distance. Our modeling results also demonstrate that the travel mobility gap is larger in the outer suburbs than in the city center and inner suburbs. Our research findings reveal that the built environment influences the travel mobility gap, which implies that marginalized groups experience some degree of social inequality and exclusion. Based on these findings, we provide policy recommendations that aim to reduce the travel mobility gap between the marginalized and reference groups. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Built environment; Marginalized groups; Mobile phone data; Transport inequality; Travel mobility gap","China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; marginalization; mobile phone; mobility; social exclusion; transportation; travel behavior","","","","","","","Bekhor S., Cohen Y., Solomon C., Evaluating long-distance travel patterns in Israel by tracking cellular phone positions, J.

A key focus is what it means in varied social arenas when most individuals live as co-present or multi-present-simultaneously engaged in digital and physical space-alone and with others. Topics include how: digital life contributes to well-being; individuals experience digital dependency; a smartphone is more than a smartphone; netiquette reveals social change; some online communities become prosocial salient havens while others reinforce social inequality; Millennials build intimacy; Latinx do familismo; and digital surveillance and big data redefine consumerism, advocacy, and civic engagement. Six chapters incorporate insights from hourly journals of Millennials undergoing a period of digital abstinence. Other chapters draw from surveys, digital auto-ethnography, content analysis, and other methods to explore digital life at the level of individual and interactive experience, and at a broader institutional and societal level. Ultimately, the book presents the need for living a mindful digital life by developing greater awareness as an individual, a social being, and a netizen and citizen. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

The research community has proposed various technical and qualitative methods intended to assist practitioners in assessing these biases. While frameworks for identifying the risks of harm due to unintended biases have been proposed, they have not yet been operationalised into practical tools to assist industry practitioners. In this paper, we link prior work on bias assessment methods to phases of a standard organisational risk management process (RMP), noting a gap in measures for helping practitioners identify bias- related risks. Targeting this gap, we introduce a bias identification methodology and questionnaire, illustrating its application through a real-world, practitioner-led use case. We validate the need and usefulness of the questionnaire through a survey of industry practitioners, which provides insights into their practical requirements and preferences. Our results indicate that such a questionnaire is helpful for proactively uncovering unexpected bias concerns, particularly where it is easy to integrate into existing processes, and facilitates communication with non-technical stakeholders. Ultimately, the effective end-to-end management of ML risks requires a more targeted identification of potential harm and its sources, so that appropriate mitigation strategies can be formulated. Towards this, our questionnaire provides a practical means to assist practitioners in identifying bias-related risks. © 2021 Owner/Author.","algorithmic bias; algorithmic fairness; fair ML; questionnaire;

As their applications move ever closer to patient care and cure in clinical settings, ethical concerns about the responsibility of their use come to the fore. I analyse an aspect of responsible ML use that bears not only an ethical but also a significant epistemic dimension. I focus on ML systems' role in mediating patient-physician relations. I thereby consider how ML systems may silence patients' voices and relativise the credibility of their opinions, which undermines their overall credibility status without valid moral and epistemic justification. More specifically, I argue that withholding credibility due to how ML systems operate can be particularly harmful to patients and, apart from adverse outcomes, qualifies as a form of testimonial injustice. I make my case for testimonial injustice in medical ML by considering ML systems currently used in the USA to predict patients' risk of misusing opioids (automated Prediction Drug Monitoring Programmes, PDMPs for short). I argue that the locus of testimonial injustice in ML-mediated medical encounters is found in the fact that these systems are treated as markers of trustworthiness on which patients' credibility is assessed. I further show how ML-based PDMPs exacerbate and further propagate social inequalities at the expense of vulnerable social groups. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. No commercial re-use.

However, due to a lack of data, to date there has been limited evidence of the extent of such within-country inequalities globally. Methods: We examined education-related inequalities in four COVID-19 prevention and testing indicators within 90 countries, using data from the University of Maryland Social Data Science Center Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, in partnership with Facebook, over the period 1 June 2021 to 31 December 2021. The overall level of education-related inequalities, as well as how they differ across country income groups and how they have changed over time were analyzed using the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and the Relative Index of Inequality (RII). We also assessed whether these education-related inequalities were associated with government policies and responses. Results: Education-related inequalities in beliefs, mask wearing, social distancing and testing varied across the study countries. Mask wearing and beliefs in the effectiveness of social distancing and mask wearing were overall more common among people with a higher level of education. Even after controlling for other sociodemographic and health-related factors, social distancing practice was higher among the most educated in low/lower middle income countries, but was higher overall among the least educated in high income countries. Overall there were low education-related inequalities in COVID-19 testing, though there was variation across countries. Conclusions: The study highlights important within-country education-related differences in COVID-19 beliefs, preventive behaviors and testing, as well as differing trends across country income groups. This has implications for considering and targeting specific population groups when designing public health interventions and messaging during the COVID-19 pandemic and future health emergencies. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19 preventive behavior; COVID-19 testing; Education-related inequality; Mask use; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Social distancing; Within-country inequality","COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Educational Status; Humans; Pandemics; Socioeconomic Factors; Maryland; United States; COVID-19; education; equity; health care; health risk; public health; risk factor; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; country economic status; COVID-19 testing; cross-sectional study; education; education related inequality; government; health behavior; health belief; high income country; human; low income country; mask wearing; middle income country; pandemic; policy; Relative Index of Inequality; scoring system; Slope Index of Inequality; social distancing; social inequality; sociodemographics; educational status; epidemiology; pandemic; prevention and control; socioeconomics","","","","","Global Affairs Canada, GAC","Funding for the journal special issue has been provided by Global Affairs Canada (GAC).

Nowadays, we are witnesses of the social inequality reflected by the salary difference between women and men for the same employment. Since the incorporation of women into the labor market in the 1980s, the wage gap between males and females has been a subject of study. One of the traditional arguments has been linked to the feminized occupations associated with sex stereotypes, as well as, low wage, birth, and discrimination in the labor categories. In the present work, we apply clustering algorithms to the PHOGUE dataset to analyze salary difference between males and females in Spain and England. © 2017 IEEE.","clustering; Data Mining; Expectation Maximization; gender discrimination; Optics","Clustering algorithms; Employment; Machine learning; Maximum principle; Wages; Clusterings; England; Expectation Maximization; Gender discrimination; Labour market; Low-wages; Machine learning approaches; Social inequalities; Data mining","","","","","","","Arranz J.M., Garcia-Serrano C., Diferencias salariales, caracter ísticas del puesto de trabajo y cualificación: un análisis para el período 2005-2010, Presupuesto y Gasto Público, 67, 2012, pp. 195-212, (2012); Oaxaca R., Male-female wage differentials in urban labor markets, International Economic Review, pp. 693-709, (1973); Becker G.S., Human capital revisited, Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis with Special Reference to Education, pp. 15-28, (1994); Mincer J., Schooling, Experience, and Earnings, 2, (1974); Rubery J., Grimshaw D., Figueiredo H., The Gender Pay Gap and Gender Mainstreaming Pay Policy in EU Member States [Synthesis Report for the Equal Opportunities Unit in the European Commission], (2003); Azmat G., Petrongolo B., Gender and the labor market: What have we learned from field and lab experiments?, Labour Economics, 30, pp. 32-40, (2014); Hernandez P.J., Mendez I., La correción del sesgo de selección en los análisis de corte transversal de discriminación salarial por sexo: estudio comparativo en los países de la unión europea, Estadística Española, 47, 158, pp. 179-210, (2005); Pedreshi D., Ruggieri S., Turini F., Discrimination-aware data mining, Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 560-568, (2008); Hajian S., Domingo-Ferrer J., A methodology for direct and indirect discrimination prevention in data mining, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 25, 7, pp. 1445-1459, (2013); Carmichael L., Stalla-Bourdillon S., Staab S., Data mining and automated discrimination: A mixed legal/technical perspective, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 31, 6, pp. 51-55, (2016); Ankerst M., Breunig M.M., Kriegel H.-P., Sander J., Optics: Ordering points to identify the clustering structure, SIGMOD Rec., 28, pp. 49-60, (1999); Ester M., Kriegel H.P., Sander J., Xu X., A Density-based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise, pp. 226-231, (1996); Dempster A.P., Laird N.M., Rubin D.B., Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the em algorithm, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Yet, the system's representation of reality can be more influential to outcomes than the complexities of daily life. They become problematic when they undermine the inclusivity of public decision making, and when their use perpetuates social or economic inequality. To address these challenges, the public must be able to participate in discourse about the implications of algorithmic systems. I propose a series of participatory installations exploring the impacts of algorithmic systems, providing contexts for active exploration of these concerns. I will conduct phenomenographic interviews to better understand how visitors experience art installations about technical topics, providing insight for subsequent installations. I will consolidate the results into a set of best practices about engaging the public on these topics.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","","Installation; Machine learning; Active explorations; Algorithmics; Daily lives; Decisions makings; Economic inequality; Machine learning algorithms; Predictive algorithms; Public decision makings; Social inequalities; System representation; Decision making","","","","","Killam Foundation; Natural Resources and Engineering Council of Canada; Alberta Innovates","The authors would like to thank the Natural Resources and Engineering Council of Canada, Alberta Innovates, and the Killam Foundation for funding this research.

This paper contributes to feeds the debate by investigating the side-effects of fiscal rules’ compliance on social welfare. It considers national Budget Balance Rules’ (BBR) compliance effects on social welfare proxies and the channel through which it operates between 2004 and 2015. Instead of fiscal rules strength or fiscal rules presence effectiveness, the study focuses on fiscal rules’ compliance to assess the impact of fiscal rules’ performance on social welfare, using a so-called “Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML)” approach (Chernozhukov et al. (2018)). The results show that governments seem to reallocate their spending to achieve both BBR’s compliance and economic objectives, with negative consequences on social expenditure. We also conclude to an increasing effect on social inequalities, suggesting that governments face a trade-off between fiscal rules’ compliance and social objectives. Thanks to the DML methodology, we also identify the key determinants of national BBR’s compliance, taking care of voter preferences by computing a new proxy variable through a Latent Factor Analysis. We conclude that voter preferences appear as a significant factor of BBR’s compliance, supporting that the Wyplosz (2012)’s bias may matter when assessing fiscal rules’ performance. © 2023 Authors.

However, life course informed research suggests that the problem of selection bias may be more complex than currently thought. This paper shows the importance of nonparametrically adjusting for the trajectory of confounder covariates for the estimation of these effects. This paper uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to estimate the total effect of the departure of the biological father on children's wellbeing, as well as delayed or fade-out effects of this transition. The paper employs Bayesian additive regression trees, a machine learning and causal inference method suited for statistical models involving high-dimensional data sets. After adjusting for multiple time-invariant and -varying confounder covariates, as well as their history, estimates of father absence's effect on children's wellbeing are reduced substantially, a finding which may be referred to as life course selection bias. Results suggest early and middle childhood are not negatively affected by the departure of the biological father. Life course selection bias mostly affects estimates of this effect on adolescence, which is explained by children directly experiencing changes inparent's socioeconomic trajectories that lead to divorce or separation. This would not be the case when father absence is experienced in early childhood. Results suggest father absence is mostly a marker of life course cumulative socioeconomic disadvantage, not a cause of negative effects. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

While many scholars address this problem from a purely techno-centric perspective, others try to raise broader social justice concerns. In this article, we join those voices and examine norms, values, and practices among European civil society organizations in relation to the topic of data and discrimination. Our goal is to decenter technology and bring nuance into the debate about its role and place in the production of social inequalities. To accomplish this, we rely on Nancy Fraser’s theory of abnormal justice which highlights interconnections between maldistribution of economic benefits, misrecognition of marginalized communities, and their misrepresentation in political processes. Fraser’s theory helps situate technologically mediated discrimination alongside other more conventional kinds of discrimination and injustice and privileges attention to economic, social, and political conditions of marginality. Using a thematic analysis of 30 interviews with civil society representatives across Europe’s human rights sector, we bring clarity to this idea of decentering. We show how many groups prioritize the specific experiences of marginalized groups and ‘see through’ technology, acknowledging its connection to larger systems of institutionalized oppression. This decentered approach contrasts the process-oriented perspective of tech-savvy civil society groups that shy from an analysis of systematic forms of injustice. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

More exactly, we estimated the income per capita by help of a machine learning model for 46 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, based on the National Polar-orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) nighttime satellite images from 2012-2018. For the automation of calculation, a new ModelBuilder type tool was developed within the ArcGIS software called EO-Incity (Earth Observation-Income city). The sum of light (SOL) data extracted by means of the EO-Incity tool and the observed income data were integrated in an algorithm within the MATLAB software in order to calculate a transfer equation and the average error. The results achieved were subsequently reintegrated in EO-Incity and used for the estimation of the income value at local level. The regression analyses highlighted a stable and strong relationship between SOL and income for the analyzed cities. The EO-Incity tool and the machine learning model proved to be efficient in the real-time estimation of the income at local level. When integrated in the information systems specific for smart cities, the y can serve as a support for decision-making in order to fight poverty and reduce social inequalities. © 2020 by the authors.","Local income; Machine learning models; Nighttime lights (NTL); NPP/VIIRS; Smart cities","Clustering algorithms; Decision making; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; MATLAB; Observatories; Regression analysis; Sols; Thermography (imaging); Turing machines; Arcgis softwares; Earth observations; Machine learning models; Night-time lights; Real-time estimation; Social inequalities; Transfer equation; Visible infrared imaging radiometer suites; Orbits","","","","","CNCS-UEFISCDI, (PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084); Ministry of Research and Innovation","Funding: This work was supported by a grant of Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084, within PNCDI III.","O'Grady M., O'Hare G., How Smart Is Your City?, Science, 335, pp. 1581-1582, (2012); World Urbanization Prospects: The 2018 Revision.; Caragliu A., Del Bo C., Nijkamp P., Smart Cities in Europe, J.

The Lisbon earthquake of 1755, for example, sparked the development of seismic construction rules. In 1848, when cholera spread through London, the first health law in the United Kingdom was passed. The Chicago fire of 1871 led to stricter building rules, which led to taller skyscrapers that were less likely to catch fire. Along similar lines, the COVID-19 epidemic may have a lasting effect, having pushed the global shift towards greener, more digital, and more inclusive cities. The pandemic highlighted the significance of smart/remote healthcare. Specifically, the elderly delayed seeking medical help for fear of contracting the infection. As a result, remote medical services were seen as a key way to keep healthcare services running smoothly. When it comes to both human and environmental health, cities play a critical role. By concentrating people and resources in a single location, the urban environment generates both health risks and opportunities to improve health. In this manuscript, we have identified the most common mental disorders and their prevalence rates in cities. We have also identified the factors that contribute to the development of mental health issues in urban spaces. Through careful analysis, we have found that multimodal feature fusion is the best method for measuring and analysing multiple signal types in real time. However, when utilizing multimodal signals, the most important issue is how we might combine them; this is an area of burgeoning research interest. To this end, we have highlighted ways to combine multimodal features for detecting and predicting mental issues such as anxiety, mood state recognition, suicidal tendencies, and substance abuse. © 2023 by the authors.","data fusion; depression; mental health; smart city; smart health","illicit drug; academic achievement; aggression; agoraphobia; anxiety; anxiety disorder; apathy; body movement; body weight; body weight fluctuation; body weight loss; boredom; cigarette smoking; city; concentration loss; cyberattack; drug dependence; drug use; energy; environmental factor; facial expression; fatigue; fear; feature extraction; functional disease; generalized anxiety disorder; grief; health hazard; health service; heart palpitation; helplessness; hot flush; human; human relation; loss of appetite; machine learning; major depression; medical care; mental disease; mental stress; mood change; panic; paresthesia; patient worry; physical disease by body function; pleasure; prevalence; restlessness; Review; rural area; sadness; school attendance; shivering; sleep disorder; social inequality; social isolation; social phobia; social stigma; social support; speech; substance abuse; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; symptom; taste disorder; urban area","","","","","Deanship of Scientific Research at University of Tabuk; University of Tabuk, (0022-1443-S)","Funding text 1: The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at University of Tabuk for funding this work through Research no. 0022-1443-S. ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at University of Tabuk through Research no. 0022-1443-S.","2018 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects, (2017); Van der Wal J.M., van Borkulo C.D., Deserno M.K., Breedvelt J.J., Lees M., Lokman J.C., Borsboom D., Denys D., van Holst R.J., Smidt M.P., Et al., Advancing urban mental health research: From complexity science to actionable targets for intervention, Lancet Psychiatry, 8, pp. 991-1000, (2021); Momen N.C., Plana-Ripoll O., Agerbo E., Benros M.E., Borglum A.D., Christensen M.K., Dalsgaard S., Degenhardt L., de Jonge P., Debost J.P.G., Et al., Association between mental disorders and subsequent medical conditions, N.

Factors such as the existence of public lighting, open sewage and garbage accumulated around the homes, as well as electricity and water supply, sanitation, and the number of residents per bathroom, are discussed as predictors of school achievements as measured using their average IDEB (Basic Education Development Index) outcomes using Data Science methods. It was found that the resident/bathroom density and the household wall material indicators in a municipality have a higher correlation with its average school achievements than the average students' socioeconomic status, relations that are clearly illustrated through bivariate choropleth maps across all the 5,388 Brazilian municipalities with available valid data. These results are compatible with research that reveals the presence of a ""neighbourhood effect,"" such that the distributional inequalities in infrastructure access and ultimately the notion of urban welfare reduces educational opportunities and engenders social inequalities, what is incompatible with the ideal of a sustainable society. © 2019 Lutheran University of Brazil.

These debates rarely engage with how racial identity is embedded in our social experience, making for sociological and psychological complexity. This complexity challenges the paradigm of considering fairness to be a formal property of supervised learning with respect to protected personal attributes. Racial identity is not simply a personal subjective quality. For people labeled “Black” it is an ascribed political category that has consequences for social differentiation embedded in systemic patterns of social inequality achieved through both social and spatial segregation. In the United States, racial classification can best be understood as a system of inherently unequal status categories that places whites as the most privileged category while signifying the Negro/black category as stigmatized. Social stigma is reinforced through the unequal distribution of societal rewards and goods along racial lines that is reinforced by state, corporate, and civic institutions and practices. This creates a dilemma for society and designers: be blind to racial group disparities and thereby reify racialized social inequality by no longer measuring systemic inequality, or be conscious of racial categories in a way that itself reifies race. We propose a third option. By preceding group fairness interventions with unsupervised learning to dynamically detect patterns of segregation, machine learning systems can mitigate the root cause of social disparities, social segregation and stratification, without further anchoring status categories of disadvantage. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Fairness; Machine learning; Racial classification; Segregation","Learning systems; Machine learning; Reinforcement; Segregation (metallography); Transparency; Computer scientists; Fairness; Formal properties; Personal attributes; Root cause; Social inequalities; Spatial segregation; Subjective quality; Distribution of goods","","","","","","","Angwin J., Larson J., Mattu S., Kirchner L., Machine Bias, (2016); Angwin J., Parris T., Facebook Lets Advertisers Exclude Users by Race, (2016); Barabas C., Dinakar K., Virza J.I., Zittrain J., Et al., Interventions over Predictions: Reframing the Ethical Debate for Actuarial Risk Assessment, (2017); Barocas S., Selbst A.D., Big data's disparate impact, Cal.

There is a greater risk of these biases in radiology, which is now the primary diagnostic tool in modern treatment. Some authors have recently proposed an analysis framework for social inequalities and the biases at risk of being introduced into future algorithms. In our paper, we comment on the different strategies for resolving these biases. We warn that there is an even greater risk in mixing the notion of equity, the definition of which is socio-political, into the design stages of these algorithms. We believe that rather than being beneficial, this could in fact harm the main purpose of these artificial intelligence tools, which is the care of the patient. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Bias; Inequity","adult; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; editor; human; machine learning; radiology","","","","","","","Pot M., Kieusseyan N., Prainsack B., Not all biases are bad: equitable and inequitable biases in machine learning and radiology, Insights Imaging, 12, 1, (2021); Braveman P., What are health disparities and health equity?

Sociologists routinely partition samples into subgroups to explore how the effects of treatments vary by selected covariates, such as race and gender, on the basis of theoretical priors. Data-driven discoveries are also routine, yet the analyses by which sociologists typically go about them are often problematic and seldom move us beyond our biases to explore new meaningful subgroups. Emerging machine learning methods based on decision trees allow researchers to explore sources of variation that they may not have previously considered or envisaged. In this article, the authors use tree-based machine learning, that is, causal trees, to recursively partition the sample to uncover sources of effect heterogeneity. Assessing a central topic in social inequality, college effects on wages, the authors compare what is learned from covariate and propensity score–based partitioning approaches with recursive partitioning based on causal trees. Decision trees, although superseded by forests for estimation, can be used to uncover subpopulations responsive to treatments. Using observational data, the authors expand on the existing causal tree literature by applying leaf-specific effect estimation strategies to adjust for observed confounding, including inverse propensity weighting, nearest neighbor matching, and doubly robust causal forests. We also assess localized balance metrics and sensitivity analyses to address the possibility of differential imbalance and unobserved confounding. The authors encourage researchers to follow similar data exploration practices in their work on variation in sociological effects and offer a straightforward framework by which to do so. © American Sociological Association 2021.","causal inference; causal trees; decision trees; heterogeneity; machine learning; random forests","","","","","","Department of Comparative Human Development; Doctorado Becas Chile, (2018-72190240); National Agency for Research and Development Scholarship Program; Population Association of American 2020; California Center for Population Research, University of California, Los Angeles, CCPR, UCLA, (P2C-HD041022); University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA; Harvard University; University of Chicago; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, UNC-CH; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CPC; International Sociological Association, ISA","Funding text 1: The authors benefited from facilities and resources provided by the California Center for Population Research at UCLA, which receives core support (P2C-HD041022) from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Patient preferences, ‘big data’, mobile digital technology and molecular and genomic profiling are among the innovative research topics that connect cancer patients to comprehensive cancer centres, and link translational research to cancer diagnosis, treatment and care. The question is whether Europe can deliver the complex infrastructure needed for universal coverage and equitable access to cancer care. The European Cancer Patient Coalition (ECPC), the leading ‘umbrella’ cancer patient organisation in Europe, has a central role in bringing the unmet needs of patients with cancer to the forefront of cancer policy, care and research. The ECPC is a respected and reliable partner in the oncology community and has effectively collaborated with institutional stakeholders and organisations, as well as with the European Commission, on cancer research projects and in the development of tools to advance health care and cancer policies at the European and national level. The ECPC believes that innovation cannot emerge and grow without patient involvement and is fully committed to increasing patient education and contribution in cancer research through its active participation in various European cancer research programmes and educational resources. The ECPC is expected to play a major role in the mission on cancer, given its previous achievements in policy and research to help overcome the inequalities in cancer prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and survivorship care. The mission on cancer will be facilitated by active collaboration between patient organisations and scientists, clinicians, politicians and industry, with the aim of identifying important research questions regarding quality of life and social issues for cancer patients of all ages. © 2019 The Authors.

However, long-term trends and contributors of racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause and cause-specific death among patients with prostate cancer remain unclear. We analysed the trends and contributors of racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer survivors according to the cause of death in the US over 25 years. Methods: In this retrospective, population-based longitudinal cohort study, we identified patients diagnosed with first primary prostate cancer between 1995 and 2019, with follow-up until Dec 31, 2019, using population-based cancer registries’ data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. We calculated the cumulative incidence of death for each racial/ethnic group (Black, white, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander [API], and American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN] people), by diagnostic period and cause of death. We quantified absolute disparities using rate changes for the 5-year cumulative incidence of death between racial/ethnic groups and diagnostic periods. We estimated relative (Hazard ratios [HR]) racial/ethnic disparities and the percentage of potential factors contributed to racial/ethnic disparities using Cox regression models. Findings: Despite a decreasing trend in the cumulative risk of death across five racial/ethnic groups, AI/AN and Black patients consistently had the highest rate of death between 1995 and 2019 with an adjusted HR of 1.48 (1.40–1.58) and 1.40 (1.38–1.42) respectively. The disparities in all-cause mortality between AI/AN and white patients increased over time, with adjusted HR 1.32 (1.17–1.49) in 1995–1999 and 1.95 (1.53–2.49) in 2015–2019. Adjustment of stage at diagnosis, initial treatment, tumor grade, and household income explained 33% and 24% of the AI/AN-white and Black-white disparities in all-cause death among patients with prostate cancer. Interpretation: The enduring racial/ethnic disparities in patients with prostate cancer, call for new interventions to eliminate health disparities. Our study provides important evidence and ways to address racial/ethnic inequality.

Examples of predicted information include purchasing power, gender, age, health, sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc. The basis for such applications of “predictive analytics” is the comparison between behavioral data (e.g. usage, tracking, or activity data) of the individual in question and the potentially anonymously processed data of many others using machine learning models or simpler statistical methods. The article starts by noting that predictive analytics has a significant potential to be abused, which manifests itself in the form of social inequality, discrimination, and exclusion. These potentials are not regulated by current data protection law in the EU; indeed, the use of anonymized mass data takes place in a largely unregulated space. Under the term “predictive privacy,” a data protection approach is presented that counters the risks of abuse of predictive analytics. A person's predictive privacy is violated when personal information about them is predicted without their knowledge and against their will based on the data of many other people. Predictive privacy is then formulated as a protected good and improvements to data protection with regard to the regulation of predictive analytics are proposed. Finally, the article points out that the goal of data protection in the context of predictive analytics is the regulation of “prediction power,” which is a new manifestation of informational power asymmetry between platform companies and society. © The Author(s) 2023.","anti-discrimination; data ethics; data protection & privacy; Predictive analytics; profiling; social inequality","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data privacy; Anti-discrimination; Behavioral data; Data ethic; Machine learning models; Power; Profiling; Purchasing power; Sexual orientations; Social inequalities; Third parties; Predictive analytics","","","","","","","Abadi M., Chu A., Goodfellow I., Et al., pp. 308-318, (2016); (2007); (2018); Baruh L., Popescu M., Big data analytics and the limits of privacy self-management, New Media & Society, 19, 4, pp. 579-596, (2017); Ben-Shahar O., Data pollution, Journal of Legal Analysis, 11, pp. 104-159, (2019); Blanke J.M., Protection for “Inferences Drawn”: A comparison between the general data protection regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, Global Privacy Law Review, 1, 2, pp. 81-92, (2020); Britz G., Informationelle Selbstbestimmung zwischen rechtswissenschaftlicher Grundsatzkritik und Beharren des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, Offene Rechtswissenschaft: ausgewählte Schriften von Wolfgang Hoffmann-Riem mit Begleitenden Analysen, pp. 561-596, (2010); (1983); (2018); Duhigg C., (2012); Dwork C., Et al., Differential privacy, Automata, Languages and Programming: 33rd International Colloquium, ICALP 2006, Venice, Italy, July 10–14, 2006, Proceedings, Part II Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4052, pp. 1-12, (2006); (2016); Eubanks V., Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor, (2017); Fischli R., Data-owning democracy: Citizen empowerment through data ownership, European Journal of Political Theory, (2022); Floridi L., Open data, data protection, and group privacy, Philosophy & Technology, 27, 1, pp. 1-3, (2014); Goggin B., (2019); Gymrek M., McGuire A.L., Golan D., Et al., Identifying personal genomes by surname inference, Science (New York, N.Y.), 339, 6117, pp. 321-324, (2013); Helm P., Group privacy in times of big data.

Some recent works have studied such impacts through social media content analysis, and supervised machine learning models have been proposed to automatically classify COVID-19 tweets into different categories, such as income and economy impacts, social inequality and justice issues, etc. In this paper, we propose semi-supervised learning models based on BERT with Self-Training and Knowledge Distillation for identifying COVID-19 tweets relevant to low-income households by leveraging readily available unlabeled data in addition to limited amounts of labeled data. Furthermore, we explore ChatGPT’s potential for annotating COVID-19 data and the performance of fine-tuned GPT-3 models. Our semi-supervised BERT model with Knowledge Distillation showed improvements compared to a supervised baseline model, while zero-shot ChatGPT showed good potential as a tool for annotating crisis data. However, our study suggests that the cost of fine-tuning large and expensive GPT-3 models may not be worth for some tasks. © 2023 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM.

While prior publications have reported the socioeconomic disparities in healthy food accessibility, little evidence has been released from developing countries, especially in China. This paper proposes a geo-big data approach to measuring transit-varying healthy food accessibility and applies it to identify the food deserts within Shenzhen, China. In particular, we develop a crawling tool to harvest the daily travel time from each community (8117) to each healthy food store (102) from the Baidu Map under four transport modes (walking, public transit, private car, and bicycle) during 17:30–20:30 in June 2016. Based on the travel time calculations, we develop four travel time indicators to measure the healthy food accessibility: the minimum, the maximum, the weighted average, and the standard deviation. Results show that the four accessibility indicators generate different estimations and the nearest service (minimum time) alone fails to reflect the multidimensional nature of healthy food accessibility. The communities within Shenzhen present quite different typology with respect to healthy food accessibility under different transport modes. Multilevel additive regression is further applied to examine the associations between healthy food accessibility and nested socioeconomic characteristics at two geographic levels (community and district). We discover that the associations are divergent with transport modes and with geographic levels. More specifically, significant social equalities in healthy food accessibility are identified via walking, public transit, and bicycle in Shenzhen. Based on the associations, we finally map the food deserts and propose corresponding planning strategies. The methods demonstrated in this study should offer deeper spatial insights into intra-urban foodscapes and provide more nuanced understanding of food deserts in urban settings of developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accessibility; Food geography; Healthy food access; Multilevel regression; Social inequalities; Transport mode","China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; accessibility; food availability; transportation mode; travel time; urban area; urban planning","","","","","","","Apparicio P., Cloutier M.S., Shearmur R., The case of Montreal's miss in food deserts: Evaluation of accessibility to food supermarkets, International Journal of Health Geographics, 6, pp. 4-13, (2007); Bader D.M.M., Purciel M., Yousefzadeh P., Neckerman K.M., Disparities in local food environments: Implications of measurement strategies, Economic Geography, 86, pp. 409-430, (2010); Bagiella E., Sloan R.P., Heitjan D.F., Mixed-effects models in psychophysiology, Psychophysiology, 37, pp. 13-20, (2000); Barnes T.L., Colabianchi N., Hibbert J.D., Porter D.E., Lawson A.B., Liese A.D., Scale effects in food environment research: Implications from assessing socioeconomic dimensions of supermarket accessibility in an eight-county region of South Carolina, Applied Geography, 68, pp. 20-27, (2016); Battersby J., Hungry cities: A critical review of urban food security research in sub-Saharan African cities, Geography Compass, 7, pp. 452-463, (2013); Bertrand L., Therien F., Cloutier M.S., Measuring and mapping disparities in access to fresh fruits and vegetables in Montreal, Canadian Journal of Public Health, 99, pp. 6-11, (2008); Black C., Moon G., Baird J., Dietary inequalities: What is the evidence for the effect of the neighbourhood food environment?, Health & Place, 27, pp. 229-242, (2014); Boruff B.J., Nathan A., Nijenstein S., Using GPS technology to (re)-examine operational definitions of neighbourhood’ in place-based health research, International Journal of Health Geographics, 11, (2012); Boulos M.N.K., Yang S.P., Exergames for health and fitness: The roles of GPS and geosocial apps, International Journal of Health Geographics, 12, (2013); Burgoine T., Monsivais P., Characterising food environment exposure at home, at work, and along commuting journeys using data on adults in the UK, International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, 10, (2013); Caspi C.E., Sorensen G., Subramanian S.V., Kawachi I., The local food environment and diet: A systematic review, Health & Place, 18, pp. 1172-1187, (2012); Cetateanu A., Jones A., How can GPS technology help us better understand exposure to the food environment?

However, morbidity and mortality are not equally distributed in the population. In spite of this, there are few studies addressing the issue of health inequalities in Europe. In this Public Health Corner article, we compare the research conducted on health inequalities in Europe to other settings and highlight the main differences based upon an extensive review of the literature. We report that only 10.2% of studies were led by European institutions or conducted in European populations and that certain topics such as alcohol-related liver disease are largely overlooked. In addition, we discuss the relevance of including a health equity lens when conducting clinical, epidemiological and health systems’ research in liver disease and set out the basic requirements to tackle health inequalities in liver disease in Europe. © 2022 European Association for the Study of the Liver","","Europe; Humans; Liver; Public Health; antivirus agent; age; alcohol abstinence; alcohol consumption; alcohol liver disease; alcoholic hepatitis; artificial intelligence; big data; chronic liver disease; conceptual framework; drug development; education; employment; epidemiological surveillance; ethnicity; Europe; food insecurity; geography; health; health care organization; health care policy; health care system; health disparity; health equity; health insurance; health practitioner; health service; hepatitis A; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; hepatitis virus; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; human; income; liver; liver disease; liver transplantation; machine learning; medical research; migrant; Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score; morbid obesity; multidisciplinary team; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; poverty; race; recidivism; scientific literature; scientist; sex; Short Survey; social determinants of health; social inequality; social psychology; socioeconomics; traffic and transport; training; underdiagnosis; universal health care; vaccination; vulnerable population; World Health Organization; epidemiology; Europe; public health","","","","","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (CEX2018-000806-S); Generalitat de Catalunya; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, ICREA","We want to thank Dr Ramiro Manzano for his support in the design of the literature search strategy.

A known problem of DNN penalizing the underrepresented population could undermine the efficacy of development projects dependent on data produced using DNN-based models. In spite of this, the problems of biases in DNN for Land Use and Land Cover Classification (LULCC) have not been a subject of many studies. In this study, we explore ways to quantify biases in DNN for land use with an example of identifying school buildings in Colombia from satellite imagery. We implement a DNN-based model by fine-tuning an existing, pre-trained model for school building identification. The model achieved overall 84% accuracy. Then, we used socioeconomic covariates to analyze possible biases in the learned representation. The retrained deep neural network was used to extract visual features (embeddings) from satellite image tiles. The embeddings were clustered into four subtypes of schools, and the accuracy of the neural network model was assessed for each cluster. The distributions of various socioeconomic covariates by clusters were analyzed to identify the links between the model accuracy and the aforementioned covariates. Our results indicate that the model accuracy is lowest (57%) where the characteristics of the landscape are predominantly related to poverty and remoteness, which confirms our original assumption on the heterogeneous performances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and their biases. Based on our findings, we identify possible sources of bias and present suggestions on how to prepare a balanced training dataset that would result in less biased AI algorithms. The framework used in our study to better understand biases in DNN models would be useful when Machine Learning (ML) techniques are adopted in lieu of ground-based data collection for international development programs. Because such programs aim to solve issues of social inequality, MLs are only applicable when they are transparent and accountable. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the role of machine learning (ML) with neuroimaging data to provide a reliable classification of ASD. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Embase was conducted to identify relevant publications. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) was used to assess the studies’ quality. A bivariate random-effects model meta-analysis was employed to evaluate the pooled sensitivity, the pooled specificity, and the diagnostic performance through the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve of ML with neuroimaging data in classifying ASD. Meta-regression was also performed. Results: Forty-four studies (5697 ASD and 6013 typically developing individuals [TD] in total) were included in the quantitative analysis. The pooled sensitivity for differentiating ASD from TD individuals was 86.25 95% confidence interval [CI] (81.24, 90.08), while the pooled specificity was 83.31 95% CI (78.12, 87.48) with a combined area under the HSROC (AUC) of 0.889. Higgins I2 (> 90%) and Cochran’s Q (p < 0.0001) suggest a high degree of heterogeneity. In the bivariate model meta-regression, a higher pooled specificity was observed in studies not using a brain atlas (90.91 95% CI [80.67, 96.00], p = 0.032). In addition, a greater pooled sensitivity was seen in studies recruiting both males and females (89.04 95% CI [83.84, 92.72], p = 0.021), and combining imaging modalities (94.12 95% [85.43, 97.76], p = 0.036). Conclusion: ML with neuroimaging data is an exciting prospect in detecting individuals with ASD but further studies are required to improve its reliability for usage in clinical practice. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Autism spectrum disorder; Machine learning; Neuroimaging; Systematic review and meta-analysis","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Neuroimaging; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; algorithm; Article; Asperger syndrome; autism; child; clinical practice; confidence interval; decision tree; deep learning; Embase; female; functional neuroimaging; human; interrater reliability; interview; learning algorithm; machine learning; major clinical study; male; Medline; meta analysis; nerve cell network; neuroimaging; predictive value; publication; publication bias; Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies; quality control; receiver operating characteristic; reliability; Scopus; social inequality; standardization; support vector machine; systematic review; diagnostic imaging; machine learning; neuroimaging; reproducibility","","","","","NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre, (BRC399/NS/RB/101410)","This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research UCLH Biomedical Research Centre (BRC399/NS/RB/101410).

James Clark School of Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States","Reopening amid the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a battle on social media. The supporters perceived that the lockdown policy could damage the economy and exacerbate social inequality. By contrast, the opponents believed it was necessary to contain the spread and ensure a safe environment for recovery. Anatomy into the battle is of importance to address public concerns, beliefs, and values, thereby enabling policymakers to determine the appropriate solutions to implement reopening policy. To this end, we investigated over 1.5 million related Twitter postings from April 17 to May 30, 2020. With the aid of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning classifiers, we classified each tweet into either a ""supporting""or ""opposing""class and then investigated the public perception from temporal and spatial perspectives. From the temporal dimension, we found that both political and scientific news that were extensively discussed on Twitter led to the perception of opposing reopening. Further, being the first mover with full reopen adversely affected the public reaction to reopening policy, while being the follower or late mover resulted in positive responses. From the spatial dimension, the correlation and regression analyses suggest that the state-level perception was very likely to be associated with political affiliation and health value. © 2021 Li et al.

Thus, it is important to examine park accessibility and how it changes over time in relation to community deprivation so as to provide all residents with equitable services. Using the Gaussian-based 2SFCA (two-step floating catchment area) method, this paper analyzes dynamic park accessibility from 2016 to 2018 for communities within the Hangzhou metropolitan area in China and then quantifies the relative role of local contributors to park accessibility changes (population, park and transport network). A machine learning algorithm, which handles the interdependences of deprivation dimensions, is further employed to determine the relationship between community deprivation and park accessibility changes. Results show that park accessibility continued to grow during the study period, and most communities achieved excellent park accessibility by 2018. Population decreases and park increases contribute positively to improved park accessibility, while transport network changes have had less of an impact. Deprived communities have observed a rising trend of park accessibility, while the elderly concentrated communities are more likely to experience declined park accessibility. Our study provides a new methodological framework, which integrates the geographical accessibility model, economic chain substitution model and machine learning algorithm, for understanding the dynamic park access and associated social inequalities in rapidly urbanizing regions. The lessons learned from this study should be insightful for urban planning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accessibility; Dynamic changes; Green spaces; Hangzhou; Neighborhood SES; Park; Social deprivation","China;

Most previous research on this topic originates from computer science. The social sciences, however, have huge potentials to contribute to research on social consequences of ADM. Based on a process model of ADM systems, we demonstrate how social sciences may advance the literature on the impacts of ADM on social inequality by uncovering and mitigating biases in training data, by understanding data processing and analysis, as well as by studying social contexts of algorithms in practice. Furthermore, we show that fairness notions need to be evaluated with respect to specific outcomes of ADM systems and with respect to concrete social contexts. Social sciences may evaluate how individuals handle algorithmic decisions in practice and how single decisions aggregate to macro social outcomes. In this overview, we highlight how social sciences can apply their knowledge on social stratification and on substantive domains of ADM applications to advance the understanding of social impacts of ADM. © The Author(s) 2022.","algorithmic decision-making; Algorithms; artificial intelligence; fair machine learning; social impacts of AI; social inequality","","","","","","Consequences of Artificial Intelligence for Urban Societies; MZES; Mannheim Centre for European Social Research; University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences; Baden-Württemberg Stiftung; Volkswagen Foundation; Universität Mannheim, UMA","Funding text 1: We thank the participants of the doctoral colloquium of the Center of Doctoral Studies in the Social and Behavioral Sciences (Sociology) at the University of Mannheim, the members of the Kreuter-Keusch research lab, as well as the anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and comments on the paper.

I argue that the adoption of big data analytics facilitates amplifications of prior surveillance practices and fundamental transformations in surveillance activities. First, discretionary assessments of risk are supplemented and quantified using risk scores. Second, data are used for predictive, rather than reactive or explanatory, purposes. Third, the proliferation of automatic alert systems makes it possible to systematically surveil an unprecedentedly large number of people. Fourth, the threshold for inclusion in law enforcement databases is lower, now including individuals who have not had direct police contact. Fifth, previously separate data systems are merged, facilitating the spread of surveillance into a wide range of institutions. Based on these findings, I develop a theoretical model of big data surveillance that can be applied to institutional domains beyond the criminal justice system. Finally, I highlight the social consequences of big data surveillance for law and social inequality. © 2017, © American Sociological Association 2017.","big data; crime; inequality; law; police","California; Los Angeles [California]; United States; crime; data processing; police force; policy analysis; surveillance and enforcement","","","","","Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy, HFSP, (5 R24 HD042849); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This research was funded by the Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy.

Unlike prior information systems explicitly programmed in formal languages, ML systems infer rules from data. This paper shows what this difference means for the critical analysis of socio-technical systems based on machine learning. To provide a foundation for future critical analysis of machine learning-based systems, we engage with how the term is framed and constructed in self-education resources. For this, we analyze machine learning tutorials, an important information source for self-learners and a key tool for the formation of the practices of the machine learning community. Our analysis identifies canonical examples of machine learning as well as important misconceptions and problematic framings. Our results show that machine learning is presented as being universally applicable and that the application of machine learning without special expertise is actively encouraged. Explanations of machine learning algorithms are missing or strongly limited. Meanwhile, the importance of data is vastly understated. This has implications for the manifestation of (new) social inequalities through machine learning-based systems. © The Author(s) 2021.","algorithms; artificial intelligence; critical data studies; data science; Machine learning; tutorials","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (374666841, SFB 1342); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01JD1803A)","The work of Hendrik Heuer and Andreas Breiter was funded by the German Research Council (DFG) under project number 374666841, SFB 1342.

Models of agent responsiveness, termed ""strategic manipulation,"" analyze the interaction between a learner and agents in a world where all agents are equally able to manipulate their features in an attempt to “trick"" a published classier. In cases of real world classication, however, an agent's ability to adapt to an algorithm is not simply a function of her personal interest in receiving a positive classication, but is bound up in a complex web of social factors that aect her ability to pursue certain action responses. In this paper, we adapt models of strategic manipulation to capture dynamics that may arise in a setting of social inequality wherein candidate groups face dierent costs to manipulation. We nd that whenever one group's costs are higher than the other's, the learner's equilibrium strategy exhibits an inequality-reinforcing phenomenon wherein the learner erroneously admits some members of the advantaged group, while erroneously excluding some members of the disadvantaged group. We also consider the eects of interventions in which a learner subsidizes members of the disadvantaged group, lowering their costs in order to improve her own classication performance. Here we encounter a paradoxical result: there exist cases in which providing a subsidy improves only the learner's utility while actually making both candidate groups worse-o-even the group receiving the subsidy. Our results reveal the potentially adverse social ramications of deploying tools that attempt to evaluate an individual's “quality” when agents' capacities to adaptively respond dier. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Fairness in machine learning; Strategic classication","Learning systems; Classication; Disadvantaged groups; Equilibrium strategy; Real-world; Social factor; Social inequalities; Transparency","","","","","","","Akyol E., Langbort C., Basar T., Price of Transparency in Strategic Machine Learning, (2016); Angwin J., Larson J., Mattu S., Kirchner L., Machine Bias, (2016); Auer P., Cesa-Bianchi N., On-line learning with malicious noise and the closure algorithm, Annals of Mathematics and Articial Intelligence, 23, 1-2, pp. 83-99, (1998); Ballwieser W., Bamberg G., Beckmann M.J., Bester H., Blickle M., Ewert R., Feichtinger G., Firchau V., Fricke F., Funke H., Et al., Agency Theory, Information, and Incentives, (2012); Bruckner M., Scheer T., Stackelberg games for adversarial prediction problems, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, (2011); Card D., Rothstein J., Racial segregation and the black-white test score gap, Journal of Public Economics, 91, 11-12, pp. 2158-2184, (2007); Datta A., Fredrikson M., Ko G., Mardziel P., Sen S., Proxy Non-Discrimination in Data-Driven Systems, (2017); Dong J., Roth A., Schutzman Z., Waggoner B., Wu Z.S., Strategic classication from revealed preferences, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation, (2018); Ensign D., Friedler S.A., Neville S., Scheidegger C., Venkatasubramanian S., Runaway feedback loops in predictive policing, Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency, (2018); Esteban J., Ray D., Inequality, lobbying, and resource allocation, American Economic Review, 96, 1, pp. 257-279, (2006); Eubanks V., Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Prole, Police, and Punish the Poor, (2018); Frankel A., Kartik N., Forthcoming Muddled information, Journal of Political Economy, (2018); Grgic-Hlaca N., Zafar M.B., Gummadi K.P., Weller A., Beyond distributive fairness in algorithmic decision making: Feature selection for procedurally fair learning, Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Articial Intelligence, (2018); Hardt M., Megiddo N., Papadimitriou C., Wootters M., Strategic classication, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science, (2016); Johnson K.D., Foster D.P., Stine R.A., Impartial Predictive Modeling: Ensuring Fairness in Arbitrary Models, (2016); Kearns M., Li M., Learning in the presence of malicious errors, SIAM J.

As an alternative to traditional agriculture, agroecology studies how polyculture creates beneficial interactions with the environment. It can reduce the ecological impact, promote the greater equality of competition, and expand the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER). However, creating an ecologically balanced system using multiple species with different growing conditions becomes a complicated task. Thus, this project uses artificial intelligence algorithms combined with georeferenced programming techniques to create Species Distribution Models (SDMs) applied to highly used plant species in agroecology inside Brazilian territory. The data required for this task is a combination of geospatial occurrences of species found in Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) with geo-environmental data made available by the WORLDCLIM and ENVIREM databases. The statistical technique used to create the models was the One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), which can differentiate regions where geo-climatic conditions offered favorable conditions for planting a given species from unfavorable regions. The metric used for evaluating the model was the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which refers to the area under the curve Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), demonstrating a binary classifier performance. The metric results ranged from 84% to 99% for the studied species. As a final result, we built a data-driven model that is capable of providing a practical guide for small and medium farmers regarding the crops that are suitable for the desired region through adaptability scores on Brazil's map. © American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual International Meeting, ASABE 2021.

With significant advances in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning among others, the algorithm can replace a human being in several tasks. However, there is a discussion about the proper definitions of data justice in which it attracts the attention of researchers from different areas such as: software engineering, law and sociology. Seeking to observe the impacts and influence that data can apply on the results of decision-making algorithms, we used a dataset from an investigative study carried out by ProPublica on the commonly cited Compas tool (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) in the area of algorithmic bias. Due to the emerging application of decision-making algorithms and other types of models by the scientific and corporate community, coupled with the disposal of various sources to extract or create datasets used to train algorithms, the need for prudence and social responsibility with the results highlights its importance to mitigate the effects of algorithmic discrimination. By investing in the search for the author of the algorithmic bias, one can aim at the structural social inequality present in these data. This due diligence is required for all steps of algorithm construction, from exploring the dataset to development and decision making. Based on the consulted literature, an Exploratory Analysis was applied to the COMPAS dataset to verify the presence of class imbalance, which in this case was confirmed. Subsequently, the Self Organizing Map (SOM) artificial neural network was applied as a visual way to analyze the impact of imbalaced data in the generation of clusters in aspects of class distribution. The experiments were divided into three steps to understand the behavior of imbalaced data: In the first stage, when data is imbalaced by class and intraclass. In the second step, when it is balanced by class. Also, in the third step by intraclass. Thus, it was possible to observe the arrangement of each element in the dataset and its relevance in the generation of the cluster, concluding that when the data balanced by the intraclass has more imbalances, they make the classifications more equal. © 2021 3rd European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, ECIAIR 2021.

We explored whether COVID-19 incidence rates differed between counties according to their socioeconomic characteristics using a wide range of indicators. Data and method We used data from the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) on 204 217 COVID-19 diagnoses in the total German population of 83.1 million, distinguishing five distinct periods between 1 January and 23 July 2020. For each period, we calculated age-standardised incidence rates of COVID-19 diagnoses on the county level and characterised the counties by 166 macro variables. We trained gradient boosting models to predict the age-standardised incidence rates with the macrostructures of the counties and used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to characterise the 20 most prominent features in terms of negative/positive correlations with the outcome variable. Results The first COVID-19 wave started as a disease in wealthy rural counties in southern Germany and ventured into poorer urban and agricultural counties during the course of the first wave. High age-standardised incidence in low socioeconomic status (SES) counties became more pronounced from the second lockdown period onwards, when wealthy counties appeared to be better protected. Features related to economic and educational characteristics of the young population in a county played an important role at the beginning of the pandemic up to the second lockdown phase, as did features related to the population living in nursing homes; those related to international migration and a large proportion of foreigners living in a county became important in the postlockdown period. Conclusion High mobility of high SES groups may drive the pandemic at the beginning of waves, while mitigation measures and beliefs about the seriousness of the pandemic as well as the compliance with mitigation measures may put lower SES groups at higher risks later on.  © ","COVID-19; epidemiology; public health; statistics & research methods","Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Incidence; Machine Learning; SARS-CoV-2; United States; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; child; coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; educational status; female; foreigner; German (citizen); Germany; human; incidence; infant; lockdown; major clinical study; male; nursing home; outcome variable; pandemic; social inequality; social status; socioeconomics; communicable disease control; incidence; machine learning; United States","","","","","","","Vestergaard L.S., Nielsen J., Richter L., Et al., Excess all-cause mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe-preliminary pooled estimates from the EuroMOMO network, March to April 2020, Eurosurveillance, (2020); Scarpone C., Brinkmann S.T., Grosse T., Et al., A multimethod approach for county-scale geospatial analysis of emerging infectious diseases: A cross-sectional case study of COVID-19 incidence in Germany, Int J Health Geogr, 19, (2020); Steiger E., Mussgnug T., Kroll L.E., Causal Analysis of COVID-19 Observational Data in German Districts Reveals Effects of Mobility, Awareness, and Temperature, (2020); Felbermayr G., Hinz J., Chowdhry S., Apres-ski: The spread of coronavirus from ischgl through Germany, Covid Economics: Vetted and Real-Time Papers, 22, pp. 177-204, (2020); Frank C., Lewandowsky M., Saad N., Der Erste Monat MIT COVID-19-Fällen im Landkreis Wittenberg, (2020); Esteve A., Permanyer I., Boertien D., National Age and Co-residence Patterns Shape covid-19 Vulnerability, (2020); Dowd J.B., Andriano L., Brazel D.M., Et al., Demographic science AIDS in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 117, pp. 9696-9698, (2020); Dudel C., Riffe T., Acosta E., Et al., Monitoring trends and differences in COVID-19 case-fatality rates using decomposition methods: Contributions of age structure and age-specific fatality, PLoS One, 15, (2020); Kulu H., Dorey P., The Contribution of Age Structure to the Number of Deaths from Covid-19 in the UK by Geographical Units, (2020); Koh D., Occupational risks for COVID-19 infection, Occup Med, 70, pp. 3-5, (2020); Prats-Uribe A., Paredes R., Prieto-Alhambra D., Ethnicity, Comorbidity, Socioeconomic Status, and Their Associations with COVID-19 Infection in England: A Cohort Analysis of UK Biobank Data, (2020); Wachtler B., Michalski N., Nowossadeck E., Socioeconomic inequalities and COVID-19-A review of the current international literature, Journal of Health Monitoring, (2020); Ehlert A., The socio-economic determinants of COVID-19: A spatial analysis of German County level data, Socioecon Plann Sci, 78, (2021); Plumper T., Neumayer E., The pandemic predominantly hits poor neighbourhoods?

Special attention is paid to the analysis of cyber-physical systems and blockchain technology as a backbone for the entire industry 4.0. The problem of the value content of new technologies, as well as the transformation of the system of values in the context of technological progress, is raised and considered. The problem of social transformations in the conditions of the fourth industrial revolution is analyzed in the context of changes in traditional boundaries and factors of social inequality. The research methodology is based on an interdisciplinary approach, within which a comparative analysis of the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution and the achievements of previous stages of technical development, as well as an attempt of humanitarian expertise of modern technologies, is carried out. The main conclusions of the conducted study are the definition of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution as objects integrating the material and digital aspects of their functioning; identifying axiological reasons for the non-acceptance of technology by society, the conclusion that the impossibility of rewriting, changing information, in particular, the history of operations in the blockchain makes traditional ideas about truth and the procedures for its establishment untenable. It is shown that social transformations caused by new technologies change existing borders and factors of social inequality. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).","Big data; Blockchain; Cyber-physical systems; Fourth industrial revolution; Social transformations","","","","","","Council on grants of the President of the Russian Federation, (MD-6911.2018.6)","1 The completed work was supported by the grant of the President of the Russian Federation, project No. MD-6911.2018.6 “Transformation of production practices and knowledge transmission in the context of network social technologies and new media” Mass production increasing tendency that persisted throughout all previous stages of industrial development initially contains a system defect. Reducing the cost and speeding up the creation of a specific product, the mass production principle paradoxically impedes its development, since it “inevitably implies a rapid“ freezing ”of the structure, making it difficult to update” (Schwab, K., 2018, 205). In addition, the gap between mass and piece production leads to an increase in expenses and, ultimately, the cost and price of unique products that do not cease to play a crucial role in many important areas, from space technology to the production of clothing and footwear. The need to produce unique mass-priced goods was also one of the reasons for the modern industrial revolution.","Alekseyeva I.Yu., Arshinov V.I., Chekletsov V.V., Technology-peopleâ€ against â€œpost-peopleâ€: NBIKS-revolution and the human future, Questions of Philosophy, 3, pp. 12-21, (2013); Almada-Lobo F., The industry 4.0 revolution and the future of manufacturing execution systems (MES), Journal of Innovation Management, 3, 4, pp. 16-21, (2016); Anderson C., Makers: The New Industrial Revolution, (2012); Chekletsov V.V., Blockchain, pokemon and industrial internet, Philosophical Sciences, 10, pp. 140-147, (2016); Chekletsov V.V., Identification and identity in the cyber-physical world, Philosophical Sciences, 8, pp. 76-86, (2017); Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS); Dutton H.W., Putting things to work: Social and policy challenges for the internet of things, Info, 16, 3, pp. 1-21, (2014); Fletcher S.R., Webb P., Industrial robot ethics: Facing the challenges of human-robot collaboration in future manufacturing systems, A World with Robots: International Conference on Robot Ethics, (2017); Gorbunov A.V., Nesterov A.Yu., Russia's technological future: Challenge of the â€œthird nature, Bulletin of the Samara University, 4, pp. 60-71, (2017); Marsh P., New Industrial Revolution: Consumers, Globalization and the End of Mass Production, (2012); Plutschinski T., The 4th industrial revolution from an ethical perspective, ISPSW Strategy Series: Focus on Defense and International Security, 516, (2017); Schwab K., Technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, (2018); Science in the American Manner: History Essays, (2014); Solomon M., The 4 Big Ethical Questions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, (2018); Yastreb N.A., Man in the Era of the Fourth Industrial Revolutionrevolution: Monograph, Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, (2015)","","Soliman K.S.","International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA","","33rd International Business Information Management Association Conference: Education Excellence and Innovation Management through Vision 2020, IBIMA 2019","10 April 2019 through 11 April 2019","Granada","152210","","978-099985512-6","","","English","Proc.

In the post-Covid-19 era, the entities that are best positioned to capitalize on these innovations are large firms, which use digital platforms and big data to orchestrate vast ecosystems of users and extract market share across industry sectors. Nonetheless, these technologies also have the potential to democratize ownership, broaden political-economic participation, and reduce environmental harms. We articulate the potential sociotechnical pathways in this high-stakes crossroads by analyzing cellular agriculture, an exemplary 4th Industrial Revolution technology that synergizes computer science, biopharma, tissue engineering, and food science to grow cultured meat, dairy, and egg products from cultured cells and/or genetically modified yeast. Our exploration of this space involved multi-sited ethnographic research in both (a) the cellular agriculture community and (b) alternative economic organizations devoted to open source licensing, member-owned cooperatives, social financing, and platform business models. Upon discussing how these latter approaches could potentially facilitate alternative sociotechnical pathways in cellular agriculture, we reflect upon the broader implications of this work with respect to the 4th Industrial Revolution and the enduring need for public policy reform. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cellular agriculture; Digital agriculture; Food and agricultural ethics; Political economy of agriculture; Rural sociology; Science, technology, and society; Social inequality","","","","","","College of Agricultural Sciences; Rural Sociological Society; USDA National Institute for Agriculture AFRI, (1019556, PENW-2018-08967); National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA, (1012188, PEN04437); Pennsylvania State University, PSU; College of Agricultural Sciences, Oregon State University, CAS; Rural Sociological Society, RSS","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Dr. Matthew Sanderson and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and comments.

We employ a cutting-edge explainable machine learning approach, known as SHAP values, to interpret an XGBoost and neural network model, as well as benchmark traditional econometric methods. The application of machine learning algorithms combined with the SHAP methodology reveals complex nonlinear relationships in the data and important insights to guide tailored policy-making. Our results suggest that there is an interaction between education and ICTs that contributes to income prediction. Furthermore, level of education and age are found to be positively associated with income, while gender presents a negative relationship; that is, women earn less than men on average. This study highlights the need for more efficient public policies to fight gender inequality in Brazil. It is also important to introduce policies that promote quality education and the teaching of skills related to technology and digitalization to prepare individuals for changes in the job market and avoid the digital divide and increasing social inequality. © 2023 The Authors","Digital divide; Gender gap; Inequality; Neural network; XGBoost","Complex networks; E-learning; Economic analysis; Machine learning; Neural network models; Public policy; Complex relationships; Digital divide; Gender gap; Income distribution; Inequality; Information and Communication Technologies; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Technology characteristics; Xgboost; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Albiman M.M., Sulong Z., The linear and non-linear impacts of ICT on economic growth, of disaggregate income groups within SSA region, Telecommunications Policy, 41, 7-8, pp. 555-572, (2017); Aldy J.E., Viscusi W.K., Adjusting the value of a statistical life for age and cohort effects, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 90, 3, pp. 573-581, (2008); Antulov-Fantulin N., Lagravinese R., Resce G., Predicting bankruptcy of local government: A machine learning approach, Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 183, pp. 681-699, (2021); Antwarg L., Miller R.M., Shapira B., Rokach L., Explaining anomalies detected by autoencoders using Shapley Additive Explanations, Expert Systems with Applications, 186, (2021); Ashraf Ganjoei R., Akbarifard H., Mashinchi M., Jalaee Esfandabadi S.A.M., Applying of fuzzy nonlinear regression to investigate the effect of information and communication technology (ICT) on income distribution, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2021, (2021); Athey S., Imbens G.W., Machine learning methods that economists should know about, Annual Review of Economics, 11, (2019); Ballester P.L., Cardoso T.D.A., Moreira F.P., da Silva R.A., Mondin T.C., Araujo R.M., de Mattos Souza L.D., 5-year incidence of suicide-risk in youth: A gradient tree boosting and SHAP study, Journal of Affective Disorders, 295, pp. 1049-1056, (2021); Barakabitze A.A., William-Andey Lazaro A., Ainea N., Mkwizu M.H., Maziku H., Matofali A.X., Iddi A., Sanga C., Transforming african education systems in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) using ICTs: Challenges and opportunities, 2019, (2019); Bauer J.M., The Internet and income inequality: Socio-economic challenges in a hyperconnected society, Telecommunications Policy, 42, 4, pp. 333-343, (2018); Beghin N., Notes on inequality and poverty in Brazil: Current situation and challenges, From Poverty to Power: How Active Citizens and Effective States Can Change the World, (2008); Booth A.L., Abels E., McCaffrey P., Development of a prognostic model for mortality in COVID-19 infection using machine learning, Modern Pathology, 34, 3, pp. 522-531, (2021); Breiman L., Statistical modeling: The two cultures, Statistical Science, 16, 3, pp. 199-231, (2001); Briglauer W., Gugler K.P., Go for gigabit?

Previous studies on social inequality focused on how independent competence valued in high-status contexts, aligns with dominant American cultural norms, while interdependent competence valued in low-status contexts, clashes with these norms. Scholarstheorised that individuals with higher status have more resources to afford independence than those with lower status. However, the reliance on Western samples may overlook the influence of cultural norms, leading to ineffective inclusive human resource development strategies. To explore how societal culture shapes competence models at different levels of status, we utilised big data analysis methods to examine job descriptions across occupational statuses and cultures. We analysed 150,708 online job descriptions posted in China and the U.S.A. on LinkedIn. Our research findings indicate that in the U.S.A, higher-status jobs place greater more emphasize independent competence, whereas in China, higher-status jobs require candidates to possess more interdependent competence. This suggests that culture, rather than material resources, shapes social stratification in the labour market. We discuss these findings’ implications, including the vital role of job descriptions in facilitating or hindering access to desired opportunities and upward social mobility across cultures and how HRD professionals can intervene in different cultural contexts. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","competence model;

Social capital theory and life course theory are combined, and it is argued that changes in social networks do not necessarily go together with changes in social capital: while personal networks are known to decline in size with age, social capital can be expected to accumulate, in particular for those who had a better starting position and therefore more resources to share. Panel data from the survey of the social networks of the Dutch (SSND) (1999-2018) at four points of measurement are employed to inquire into this argument. Social capital is measured by the position generator instrument, and three indicators, that is, resource extensity, mean prestige access, and resource range are analyzed. Results of fixed effect models show that, on average, people maintain access to social capital, and that men and higher educated gain social capital through their life as opposed to women and lower educated. Implications for the understanding of the reproduction of social inequality are discussed. The paper concludes with a reflection upon the value of ego-centered network analysis in the era of big data and data science.  © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Here, we assess the role of social stereotypes in the automated detection of hate speech in the English language by examining the impact of social stereotypes on annotation behaviors, annotated datasets, and hate speech classifiers. Specifically, we first investigate the impact of novice annotators’ stereotypes on their hate-speech-annotation behavior. Then, we examine the effect of normative stereotypes in language on the aggregated annota-tors’ judgments in a large annotated corpus. Finally, we demonstrate how normative stereotypes embedded in language resources are associated with systematic prediction errors in a hate-speech classifier. The results demonstrate that hate-speech classifiers reflect social stereotypes against marginalized groups, which can perpetuate social inequalities when propagated at scale. This framework, combin-ing social-psychological and computational-linguistic methods, provides insights into sources of bias in hate-speech moderation, informing ongoing debates regarding machine learning fairness. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

Given their intended placement within healthcare decision making more broadly, ML tools require attention to adequately quantify the impact of bias and reduce its potential to exacerbate inequalities. We suggest that taking a patient safety and quality improvement approach to bias can support the quantification of bias-related effects on ML. Drawing from the ethical principles underpinning these approaches, we argue that patient safety and quality improvement lenses support the quantification of relevant performance metrics, in order to minimize harm while promoting accountability, justice, and transparency. We identify specific methods for operationalizing these principles with the goal of attending to bias to support better decision making in light of controllable and uncontrollable factors. © The Author(s) 2020.","Healthcare delivery; Machine learning; Patient safety; Quality improvement; Systematic bias","Artificial Intelligence; Data Collection; Government Regulation; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Patient Safety; Prejudice; Quality Improvement; Social Determinants of Health; adult; decision making; drawing; drug safety; health care delivery; human; justice; machine learning; patient safety; review; statistical bias; total quality management; artificial intelligence; ethics; government regulation; health care disparity; information processing; prejudice; social determinants of health","","","","","","","Chen IY, Szolovits P, Ghassemi M., Can AI help reduce disparities in general medical and mental health care?, AMA J Ethics, 21, 2, pp. 167-179, (2019); Zhang H, Lu AX, Abdalla M, McDermott M, Ghassemi M., Hurtful words: quantifying biases in clinical contextual word embeddings, proceedings of the ACM Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning, pp. 110-120, (2020); Pfohl S, Marafino B, Coulet A, Rodriguez F, Palaniappan L, Shah NH., Creating fair models of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, proceedings of the 2019 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, pp. 271-278, (2019); Smedley BD, Stith AY, Nelson AR., Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Healthcare, (2002); Davidson KW, McGinn T., Screening for social determinants of health: the known and unknown, JAMA, 322, 11, pp. 1037-1038, (2019); Marmot M., Social determinants of health inequalities, Lancet, 365, 9464, pp. 1099-1104, (2005); Benjamin R., Assessing risk, automating racism, Science, 366, 6464, pp. 421-422, (2019); Obermeyer Z, Powers B, Vogeli C, Mullainathan S., Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations, Science, 366, 6464, pp. 447-453, (2019); Buolamwini J, Gebru T., Gender shades: Intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classification, conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency, pp. 77-91, (2018); Dwork C, Hardt M, Pitassi T, Reingold O, Zemel R., Fairness through awareness, proceedings of the 3rd Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, pp. 214-226, (2012); Angwin J, Larson J, Mattu S, Kirchner L., There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals and it’s biased against blacks, (2016); De-Arteaga M, Romanov A, Wallach H, Et al., Bias in bios: A case study of semantic representation bias in a high-stakes setting, proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, pp. 120-128, (2019); Bolukbasi T, Chang KW, Zou JY, Saligrama V, Kalai AT., Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker?

Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic pregnant women appear to have disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 infection and death rates. Methods and analysis We will use the socioecological framework and employ a concurrent triangulation, mixed-methods study design to achieve three specific aims: (1) examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality (SMMM); (2) explore how social contexts (eg, racial/ethnic residential segregation) have contributed to the widening of racial/ethnic disparities in SMMM during the pandemic and identify distinct mediating pathways through maternity care and mental health; and (3) determine the role of social contextual factors on racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related morbidities using machine learning algorithms. We will leverage an existing South Carolina COVID-19 Cohort by creating a pregnancy cohort that links COVID-19 testing data, electronic health records (EHRs), vital records data, healthcare utilisation data and billing data for all births in South Carolina (SC) between 2018 and 2021 (>200 000 births). We will also conduct similar analyses using EHR data from the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative including >270 000 women who had a childbirth between 2018 and 2021 in the USA. We will use a convergent parallel design which includes a quantitative analysis of data from the 2018-2021 SC Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (unweighted n>2000) and in-depth interviews of 40 postpartum women and 10 maternal care providers to identify distinct mediating pathways. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by institutional review boards at the University of SC (Pro00115169) and the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC IRB.21-030). Informed consent will be provided by the participants in the in-depth interviews. Study findings will be disseminated with key stakeholders including patients, presented at academic conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

In the coming decades, we will have unprecedented opportunities to improve MCH, but will also face unprecedented threats. Methods: This paper examines emerging opportunities and threats to MCH, and discusses strategies for leading the future of MCH. Results: Scientific advancements will continue to drive improvements in MCH, but to unleash its full potential for improving population health future MCH research must become more transdisciplinary, translational, and precise. Technological innovations could dramatically transform our work in MCH while big data could enhance predictive analytics and precision health; our challenge will be to assure equitable access. The greatest gains in MCH will continue to come from improving social conditions, which will require advancing MCH in all policies. Climate change, infectious outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance pose increasing threats to MCH, which can be averted by reducing global warming, implementing global early warning systems, and instituting responsible antimicrobial stewardship. The growing burden of chronic diseases in children and adults need to be addressed from an ecological and life course perspective. The water crisis in Flint shined a spotlight on the growing health threats from America’s decaying infrastructure. Discussion: We can lead the future of MCH by starting a national conversation, improving MCH research, and preparing future MCH workforce, but the future of MCH will depend on our effectiveness in bringing about social and political change in the coming decades. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","All policies; Antimicrobial resistance; Big data; Chronic diseases; Climate change; Future of maternal and child health; Health; Health in; Infectious outbreaks; Infrastructure; Innovation; Life course; Precision; Research; Social inequality; Technology; Workforce","Climate Change; Cost of Illness; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Maternal-Child Health Services; climate change; cost of illness; epidemic; human; maternal child health care; statistics and numerical data; trends","","","","","","","Infrastructure report card.

Capitalising on the infrastructure developed through the 100,000 Genomes Project, the GMS is underpinned by seven supra-regional Genomic Laboratory Hubs (GLHs) delivering the new inherited rare disease and cancer somatic tissue genetic test directory. This replaces the UKGTN test directory, with the aim of standardising criteria for whole genome sequencing or targeted panel tests where applicable. The new test directory will define who can order specific genetic tests under prescribed eligibility criteria. In keeping with Dame Sally Davies' white paper Generation Genome, this will further democratise genetic testing and, in some situations, avoid the need to refer to clinical genetics to access testing. The aim is to simplify patient pathways and reduce regional or social inequalities. We will discuss the implications of whole genome sequencing and the potential impact of the new nationally commissioned GMS for both patients, their relatives and clinicians. We will also discuss the imminent challenges in implementing genomic medicine into the NHS, and the future impact of novel technologies on service delivery as genomic medicine becomes increasingly integrated into routine healthcare. © Royal College of Physicians 2019.

Despite the general utility of these health care algorithms, there is growing recognition that they may lead to unintended racially discriminatory practices, raising concerns about the potential for algorithmic bias. An intuitive precaution against such bias is to remove race and ethnicity information as an input to health care algorithms, mimicking the idea of “race-blind” decisions. However, we argue that this approach is misguided. Knowledge, not ignorance, of race and ethnicity is necessary to combat algorithmic bias. When race and ethnicity are observed, many methodological approaches can be used to enforce equitable algorithmic performance. When race and ethnicity information is unavailable, which is often the case, imputing them can expand opportunities to not only identify and assess algorithmic bias but also combat it in both clinical and nonclinical settings. A valid imputation method, such as Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, can be applied to standard data collected by public and private payers and provider entities. We describe two applications in which imputation of race and ethnicity can help mitigate potential algorithmic biases: equitable disease screening algorithms using machine learning and equitable pay-for-performance incentives. © 2022 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.","","Algorithms;

Urban Green and Blue Spaces (UGBS), and the activities that take place in them, can significantly influence the health outcomes of all communities, and reduce health inequalities. Improving access and quality of UGBS needs understanding of the range of systems (e.g. planning, transport, environment, community) in which UGBS are located. UGBS offers an ideal exemplar for testing systems innovations as it reflects place-based and whole society processes, with potential to reduce non-communicable disease (NCD) risk and associated social inequalities in health. UGBS can impact multiple behavioural and environmental aetiological pathways. However, the systems which desire, design, develop, and deliver UGBS are fragmented and siloed, with ineffective mechanisms for data generation, knowledge exchange and mobilisation. Further, UGBS need to be co-designed with and by those whose health could benefit most from them, so they are appropriate, accessible, valued and used well. This paper describes a major new prevention research programme and partnership, GroundsWell, which aims to transform UGBS-related systems by improving how we plan, design, evaluate and manage UGBS so that it benefits all communities, especially those who are in poorest health. We use a broad definition of health to include physical, mental, social wellbeing and quality of life. Our objectives are to transform systems so that UGBS are planned, developed, implemented, maintained and evaluated with our communities and data systems to enhance health and reduce inequalities. GroundsWell will use interdisciplinary, problem-solving approaches to accelerate and optimise community collaborations among citizens, users, implementers, policymakers and researchers to impact research, policy, practice and active citizenship.

However, rather few studies have empirically been conducted in respect of bicycling, especially in developing countries. Using the case of Shenzhen in China, this paper explores bicycling behavior associated with neighborhood social disadvantage (NSD). Data of 3 explained variables (bicycling frequency, travel duration and trip distance) for bicycling behavior is crawled from mobile application programming interface. Based on a set of 16 potential social indicators, we apply principal component analysis to construct NSD index and it produces 5 sub-indices including income, housing, occupation, education and population. Results of spatial regression demonstrate that NSD generally is positive with bicycling frequency and trip distance, while negative with travel duration. Specifically, income and population disadvantaged neighborhoods tend to bicycling for higher frequency, less time and longer distance. Housing disadvantage and education disadvantage reduce the likelihood of bicycling, while occupation disadvantage encourages bicycling frequency and trip distance. The variance decomposition shows that income disadvantage contributes most for bicycling frequency, housing disadvantage is more important for travel duration. For trip distance, education disadvantage is more influential. Our attempt provides an innovative insight into social indicators research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Bicycling behavior; Big data; Neighborhood social disadvantage; Principle component analysis; Spatial approach","China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; cycle transport; developing world; equity; neighborhood; principal component analysis; social indicator; spatial analysis; travel behavior; urban society","","","","","","","Alvarado S.E., Neighborhood disadvantage and obesity across childhood and adolescence: Evidence from the nlsy children and young adults cohort (1986–2010), Social Science Research, 57, (2016); Anselin L., Spatial econometrics: Methods and models, Economic Geography, 65, 2, pp. 160-162, (1988); Anselin L., Syabri I., Kho Y., Geoda: An introduction to spatial data analysis, Geographical Analysis, 38, 1, pp. 5-22, (2006); Barnes T.L., Colabianchi N., Hibbert J.D., Porter D.E., Lawson A.B., Liese A.D., Scale effects in food environment research: Implications from assessing socioeconomic dimensions of supermarket accessibility in an eight-county region of south carolina, Applied Geography, 68, pp. 20-27, (2016); Castillo-Manzano J.I., Lopez-Valpuesta L., Sanchez-Braza A., Going a long way?

Social inequality, violence, and malnutrition have strong impact on youth health. To better understand these issues we propose to combine machine-learning methods and graph analysis to build predictive networks applied to the Brazilian National Student Health Survey (PenSE 2015) data, a large dataset that consists of questionnaires filled by the students. By using a combination of gradient boosting machines and centrality hub metric, it was possible to identify potential confounders to be considered when conducting association analyses among variables. The variables were ranked according to their hub centrality to predict the other variables from a directed weighted-graph perspective. The top five ranked confounder variables were ""gender"", ""oral health care"", ""intended education level"", and two variables associated with nutrition habits-""eat while watching TV"" and ""never eat fast-food"". In conclusion, although causal effects cannot be inferred from the data, we believe that the proposed approach might be a useful tool to obtain novel insights on the association between variables and to identify general factors related to health conditions.","adolescent; graph; machine-learning; network; public health","Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Brazil; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Nutrition Assessment; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; adolescent; adolescent health; Brazil; female; human; machine learning; male; nutritional assessment; social class; socioeconomics","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","16604601","","","31877700","English","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077279645"

Support technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing open avenues for widening the circle of people involved in deliberation, moving from small groups to “crowd” scale. Numerous design features of large-scale online discussion systems allow larger numbers of people to discuss shared problems, enhance critical thinking, and formulate solutions. We review the transdisciplinary literature on the design of digital mass deliberation platforms and examine the commonly featured design aspects (e.g., argumentation support, automated facilitation, and gamification) that attempt to facilitate scaling up. We find that the literature is largely focused on developing technical fixes for scaling up deliberation, but may neglect the more nuanced requirements of high quality deliberation. Furthermore, current design research is carried out with a small, atypical segment of the world's population, and little research deals with how to facilitate and accommodate different genders or cultures in deliberation, counter pre-existing social inequalities, build motivation and self-efficacy in certain groups, or deal with differences in cognitive abilities and cultural or linguistic differences. We make design and process recommendations to correct this course and suggest avenues for future research.

Health is one of the key areas for digitalization, where the benefits of using big data are obvious. New technologies are often а basis for modernizing national health systems for they make possible to ensure availability of various medical services for different groups of population. Lupton analyzes both the benefits and risks of digitalization in this area, thereby highlighting ambivalent character of the ongoing changes. She believes that it is necessary to recognize the interaction not only between people, but also between people and digital technologies. These new relationships form a new social reality. The Australian sociologist focuses her attention on new opportunities due to digitalization which can improve people’s lives. From her point of view, the “concept of fear” still dominant in social research of digital technologies should be replaced by the concept of “thinking with care”, according to which the data obtained as a result of using new technologies can and should be used for the benefit of humanity. Lupton demonstrates that digital data can help reorganize health care system and change patterns in people’s behavior related to their health, in particular, through the ability to regularly monitor indicators of one’s condition. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.

A number of indices have been developed to track female empowerment at the national level, but these are incomplete and may obscure important sub-national variation. We developed the Female Empowerment Index (FEMI) to track multiple domains of women's empowerment at the sub-national level. The index is based on six categories of empowerment: violence against women, employment, education, reproductive healthcare, decision making, and access to contraceptives. The FEMI has a range of zero to one (low to high empowerment), and it is calculated as the mean proportion of positive outcomes in the six categories. To provide a proof of concept, we computed the FEMI for Nigeria and its 36 states from five Demographic and Health Surveys between the years of 1990 and 2013, using questions asked to 98,542 women between 15 and 49 years old. At the national level, the FEMI increased from 0.34 to 0.48. However, there was substantial sub-national variation, with state-level values ranging from 0.16-0.60 in 1990 to 0.19–0.73 in 2013. Our findings thus illustrate the importance of considering sub-national variation in female empowerment. The FEMI can be readily computed for other countries, and its ability to track spatial and temporal variation in woman's empowerment across a broad set of categories may make it more useful than existing approaches. © 2020; Africa; Nigeria; women's empowerment; demographic and health surveys; gender inequality; Machine Learning; Data Analytics; Data Visualization; Big Data; Data Mining; Human Geography; Social Inequality; Human Rights; Geography, Sociology, Information Science. © 2020","Africa; Big data; Data analytics; Data mining; Data visualization; Demographic and health surveys; Gender inequality; Geography; Human geography; Human rights; Information science; Machine learning; Nigeria; Social inequality; Sociology; Women's empowerment","","","","","","Feed the Future Sustainable Intensification Innovation Lab; United States Agency for International Development, USAID, (AID-OOA-L-14-00006); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP1099842)","This work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (USA) under grant OPP1099842 and by the Feed the Future Sustainable Intensification Innovation Lab (SIIL) under the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID) grant AID-OOA-L-14-00006 .

These systems often address Health Inequalities during healthcare promotion. Unfortunately, the complexity of these inequalities continuously affects vulnerable populations and developing economies. This is mainly attributed to the variations in social determinants caused by social inequalities among social groups in the general population with their intersecting social factors. Numerous technologies like Mobile Health have been developed to address issues of Equitable access to healthcare. Unfortunately, some of the disruptive underlying innovative technologies facilitating Mobile health for example Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) still exhibit algorithmic unfairness. This is mainly attributed to inequitable healthcare datasets arising from the contextual and intersectional differences among the beneficiaries of the Mobile Health services. Moreover, AI and ML are now globally adopted in establishing sustainable intelligent predictive and preventive Mobile Healthcare systems, despite the lag in shifting and adopting contextually appealing research paradigms for responsibly creating inclusive AI and ML training datasets for Intelligent Healthcare Technologies. This chapter critically reviews conventional research paradigms, their essential elements, and their contextual application in creating AI and ML training datasets for sustainable healthcare and Health Equity. This review finally recommends responsible and Inclusive Intersectional AI research approaches to creating ML and AI Training datasets for Equitable Mobile Health Technologies and sustainable intelligent healthcare systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial ıntelligence; Dataset creation; Health equity; Mobile health; Research paradigms","Economic and social effects; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Machine learning; Artificial ıntelligence; Artificial intelligence learning; Critical review; Dataset creation; Health equity; Healthcare systems; Healthcare technology; Machine-learning; Research paradigm; Training dataset; mHealth","","","","","","","Bourdeau M., Auguste Comte, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, (2022); Johnson R.B., Onwuegbuzie A.J., Mixed methods research: A research paradigm whose time has come, Educ Res, 33, 7, pp. 14-26, (2004); Kaushik V., Walsh C.A., Pragmatism as a research paradigm and its implications for social work research, Soc.

This study monitored multi-decadal building density (1991– 2019) in the Yogyakarta urban area, Indonesia consisting of two stages, i.e., built-up area classification and building density estimation, therefore, both built-up expansion and the densification were quantified. Multi sensors of the Landsat series including Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were utilized with some prior corrections to harmonize the reflectance values. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to distinguish between built-up and non built-up areas. Regression algorithms, i.e., linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR) were explored to obtain the best model to estimate building density using the inputs of built-up indices: Urban Index (UI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), and NIR-based built-up index based on the red (VrNIR-BI) and green band (VgNIR-BI). The best models were revealed by SVR with the inputs of UI-NDBI-IBI and LR with a single predictor of UI, for Landsat 8 (2013–2019) and Landsat 5/7 (1991–2009), respectively, using separate training samples. We found that machine learning regressions (SVM and RF) could perform best when the sample size is abundant, whereas LR could predict better for a limited sample size if a linear positive relationship was identified between the predictor(s) and building density. We conclude that expansion in the study area occurred first, followed by rapid building development in the subsequent years leading to an increase in building density. © 2022 by the authors.

It notes that many AI4SG initiatives are shaped by the same corporate entities that incubate AI technologies, beyond democratic control, and stand to profit monetarily from their deployment. Such initiatives often pre-frame systemic social and environmental problems in tech-centric ways, while suggesting that addressing such problems hinges on more or better data. They thereby perpetuate incomplete, distorted models of social change that claim to be ‘data-driven’. In the process, AI4SG initiatives may obscure or ‘ethics wash’ all the other uses of big data analytics and AI that more routinely serve private interests and exacerbate social inequalities. As a case in point, it discusses the prominence of health-related applications in AI and big data fields, alongside the politics of more ‘upstream’ versus ‘downstream’ health interventions. © 2020 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","AI Ethics;

We apply this analysis specifically to UK-REACH (The United Kingdom Research Study into Ethnicity and Covid-19 Outcomes in Healthcare Workers), a project with which we are involved. We argue that Big Data projects like UK-REACH can be conducted in an ethically robust manner and that funders and sponsors ought to encourage similar projects to drive better evidence-based public policy in public health. As part of this, we advocate that a Big Data ethics-by-design approach be undertaken when such projects are constructed. This principle extends the work of those who advocate ethics by design by addressing prominent issues in Big Data health research projects; it holds that ethical values and principles in Big Data health research projects are best adhered to when they are already integrated into the project aims and methods at the design stage. In advocating this principle, we present a unique perspective regarding pressing ethical problems around large-scale, data-driven Covid-19 research, as well as legal issues associated with processing ostensibly anonymized health data. © 2021 The Authors.

However, the labour market has largely remained a ‘black box’ in sociological and education policy studies. This article draws on ‘big data’ from over 21,000,000 job adverts to explore how employers in the UK describe job requirements, with particular reference to the role of credentials. It challenges existing theories premised upon the notion that higher levels of formal education determine individual (dis)advantage in the competition for jobs. Although they have different views of the relationship between credentials, opportunity and efficiency, these theories assume that credentials largely determine occupational hiring. Our analysis suggests that formal academic credentials play a relatively minor differentiating role in the UK labour market, as the majority of employer’s place greater emphasis on ‘job readiness’. This raises a number of issues for sociological and policy analysis, including the future role of credentials in the (re)production of educational and labour market inequalities. Methodologically, the article highlights how the use of big data can contribute to the analysis of education, skills and the labour market. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","big data; credential society; job adverts analysis; job readiness; Qualifications; queue theory; social closure theory; social inequality; technical-function theories; UK","","","","","","","","Arrow K., Higher Education as a Filter, Journal of Public Economics, 2, pp. 193-216, (1973); Bell D., The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, (1973); Bennett R., Employers’ Demands for Personal Transferable Skills in Graduates: A Content Analysis of 1,000 Job Advertisements and an Associated Empirical Study, Journal of Vocational Education and Training, 54, 4, pp. 457-476, (2002); Berg I., Education and Jobs: The Great Training Robbery, (1970); Bills D.B., Congested Credentials: The Material and Positional Economies of Schooling, Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, 43, pp. 65-70, (2016); Bourdieu P., Boltanski L., Changes in Social Structure and Changes in the Demand for Education, Contemporary Europe: Social Structure and Cultural Change, pp. 197-227, (1978); Bourdieu P., Passeron J., Reproduction in Education, Society, and Culture, (1977); Brauns H., Gangl M., Scherer S., Education and Unemployment: Patterns of Labour Market Entry in France, the United Kingdom and West Germany, (1999); Breen R., Luijkx R., Conclusions, Social Mobility in Europe, pp. 383-410, (2004); Breen R., Social Mobility in Europe, (2004); Breen R., Hannan D.F., O'Leary R., Returns to Education: Taking Account of Employers’ Perceptions and Use of Educational Credentials, European Sociological Review, 11, pp. 59-73, (1995); Breen R., Goldthorpe J.H., Class, Mobility and the Merit Experience of Two British Birth Cohorts, European Sociological Review, 17, 2, pp. 81-101, (2001); Brockmann M., Clarke L., Winch C., Knowledge, Skills and Competence in the European Labour Market, (2011); Brown P., Education, Opportunity and the Prospects for Social Mobility, British Journal of Sociology of Education, 34, 5-6, pp. 678-700, (2013); Brown P., Hesketh A., The Mismanagement of Talent, (2004); Brown P., The global auction: The broken promises of education, jobs, and incomes., (2011); Operating in Real Time: Using Real-Time Labour Market Data to Enhance Research Efficacy and Guide Workforce and Economic Development Decisions, (2015); Burrows R., Savage M., After The Crisis?

Social inequality, violence, and malnutrition have strong impact on youth health. To better understand these issues we propose to combine machine-learning methods and graph analysis to build predictive networks applied to the Brazilian National Student Health Survey (PenSE 2015) data, a large dataset that consists of questionnaires filled by the students. By using a combination of gradient boosting machines and centrality hub metric, it was possible to identify potential confounders to be considered when conducting association analyses among variables. The variables were ranked according to their hub centrality to predict the other variables from a directed weighted-graph perspective. The top five ranked confounder variables were “gender”, “oral health care”, “intended education level”, and two variables associated with nutrition habits—“eat while watching TV” and “never eat fast-food”. In conclusion, although causal effects cannot be inferred from the data, we believe that the proposed approach might be a useful tool to obtain novel insights on the association between variables and to identify general factors related to health conditions. © 2019 by the authors.

More sustainable Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have become an indispensable part of the transport offer by world's major metropolis. Like any computerized service system, they generate voluminous and complex data that the use of which is essentially limited to the management and operation of the system. The movements made by system users can provide valuable information on many aspects of urban life including the spatial and temporal dynamics of travel in the city, on the place of the bicycle among other modes of transport, or on the distribution of territorial and social inequalities in geographical space. In this paper, we study the problem of intelligent management of shared bicycle systems. Indeed, the management of these systems faces many optimization problems in its procession. Thus, to improve the BSS user's satisfaction, it's useful to inform the actors/users in this system about the state of bike sharing for a station. For this, we propose an approach that integrates in these systems both the new IoT for smart city technologies and machine learning in order to facilitate the task of management, availability and profitability. In addition, we propose an automatic management system capable of predicting the number of bikes shared per hour, day or month by taking several dynamic parameters. Simulation results carried out on real data from London's bike sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bike-sharing system (BSS); Ensemble models; Internet of Things (IoT);

The sustainable mobility of people and goods allows access to education, culture, housing, work, leisure, and food, it is part of millions of people every day and is one of the factors that most influence the path towards decarbonization, reduction of the greenhouse, gas emissions, improving the health of citizens and providing economic benefits. For this reason, it is essential to rethink mobility towards a more sustainable one by exploiting data and existing and in-the-field sensors. This project aims to build a platform capable of helping contemporary cities in the transformation towards sustainable, resilient, and healthy cities through the exploitation of data, both existing and sensors in the field. We propose to build a 2-layer platform committed to (1) quantitative data processing, which can be merged, processed, and visualized, using Big Data processing techniques to display relevant data and extract relevant information in the field of urban design, and (2) strategic system, which will assist in the definition of criteria to help citizens and regional governments to solve the problems derived from the design of contemporary cities. The efficient use of available technologies, aimed at improving the quality of life of the population, will lead to greater care for the environment and the reduction of social inequality. The proposed approach will integrate into existing decision support systems by providing quantitative and qualitative suggestions on sustainable policy architecture to drive healthy environmental and mobility management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big Data; Sustainable mobility; urban design","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Leisure; Metadata; Sustainable development; % reductions; Barcelona; Case-studies; Circular economy; Decarbonisation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Impact on the environment; Mode of transport; Sustainable mobility; Urban design; Big data","","","","","Barcelona City Council; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (22S09490-001)","The project has been financed by the Barcelona City Council and the Ministry of Science and Innovation within the framework of Barcelona’s Cultural and Scientific Capital.

In this article, we analyze daily COVID-19 infection data with two objectives: (i) to test the predictive power of a Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) on the daily stochastic fluctuation in different scenarios, and (ii) analyze, through adaptive linear regression, possible anomalies in the reported data to provide a more realistic and reliable scenario to support epidemic control actions. Our results show that the approach is even more suitable for countries, states or cities where the rate of testing, diagnosis and prevention were low during the virus dissemination. In this sense, we focused on investigating countries and regions where the disease evolved in a severe and poorly controlled way, as in Brazil, highlighting the favelas in Rio de Janeiro as a regional scenario. © 2022, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

The environmental quality of the cities are affected by the uncontrolled usage of natural resources, the sprawl of settlements, unplanned development and large-scale industrial activities. The urban forms pose the primary challenges to humanity by rapidly depleting natural resources, enhancing climate change, global, regional, and local conflicts resulting in ineffective governance. It's essential to account for the driving forces contributing to urban growth and their effects on the city's environment, which aid in sustainability. The present research has assessed the land use change in the CRDA region through machine learning and deep learning approaches. The detailed digital infrastructure portrays the capabilities of sensing, controlling, and analyzing current and likely urban growth forms aids as a foundation for smart planning and sustainable development. The deep learning model shows a greater increase in built-up cover of 13% compared to 10% in the year 2022. The research findings provide valuable insights into urban growth, which aids the decision-makers in determining sustainable developmental measures and effective regional planning. © 2023 IEEE.","Deep Learning;

The first part focuses primarily on the global labour relations approach, within the broader debate on social inequality and migration. The second part illustrates the potential of labour as an independent variable by reflecting on recent innovative work pertaining to labour-intensive industrializations in East Asia and Europe. The third part employs the perspective of migration to show the interrelated nature of labour relations and labour. Using the insights from the global labour relations approach and by taking labour seriously, the article will help to address core questions in labour history in a more structural way: why has work been valued and compensated in very different ways over the past five centuries? And how have people individually or collectively influenced these conditions? To find answers, it is crucial to make use of standardized empirical data, structured global comparisons, and more intensive collaborations.

As the ""super-new-big"" purports to identify a contemporary moment in which we are witnessing unprecedented change, I interrogate the degree to which these concepts rely on assumptions about ""reality"" as natural state versus ideological production. I consider how the super-new-big invites us to scrutinize various reconceptualizations of diversity (is it super?), media (is it new?), and data (is it big?), leaving us to inevitably contemplate each concept's implicitly invoked opposite: ""regular diversity,"" ""old media,"" and ""small data."" In the section on ""diversity,"" I explore linguistic anthropological scholarship that examines how notions of difference continue to be entangled in projects of the nation-state, the market economy, and social inequality. In the sections on ""media"" and ""data,"" I consider how questions about what constitutes linguistic anthropological data and methodology are being raised and addressed by research that analyzes new and old technologies, ethnographic material, semiotic forms, scale, and ontology. I conclude by questioning the extent to which it is the super-new-big itself or the contemplation about the super-new-big that produces perceived change in the world. © 2014 by the American Anthropological Association.","Big data; Linguistic anthropology; New media; Ontology; Semiotics; Superdiversity; Technology","","","","","","","","Agha A., The Social Life of Cultural Value.

We know much about the benefits brought by its recent developments, including the Internet with its numerous applications. At the same time, there is increasing concern that the economic emphasis linked to these technologies will widen the digital divide, potentially sharpening social inequalities in a global scale. However, it has come ever more clear that it is not technology as such that is the cause of the social problems with digital communications technology but the ways how it has been applied, reflecting unequal power relations in our societies. There are a number of disturbing questions concerning the long-term effects of the social and cultural deployment of Information and Communications Technology. Some of the questions we address in this article here are the following: Can digital Information and Communications Technology still be regulated nationally? How do we measure the effects of Information and Communications Technology on academic work? How should we think critically about big data? Has digital Information and Communications Technology improved our lives? © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Big data; digital divide; Information and Communications Technology policy; media and communication regulation; media and democracy","","","","","","","","Abrams S., The children must play, (2011); Funding instrument for strategic research, (2014); Strategic research funding, (2015); Agrawal D., Bernstein P., Bertino E., Et al., Challenges and opportunities with big data: A community white paper developed by leading researchers across the United States, (2012); Bailey M., Freedman D., The Assault on Universities: A Manifesto for Resistance, (2011); Bangemann M., da Fonseca E.C., Davis P., Et al., Recommendations to the European Council: Europe and the Global Information Society, Members of the High-Level Group on the Information Society, (1994); Bertino E., Big data – Opportunities and challenges, Panel position paper: IEEE 37th annual computer software and applications conference, (2013); boyd D., Privacy and publicity in the context of big data, (2010); boyd D., Crawford K., Critical questions for big data, Information, Communication & Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Burawoy M., Redefining the Public University: Developing an analytical framework, (2011); Carrigan M., Kitchin R., Big data should complement small data, not replace them, The Philosophy of Data Science, (2014); Castells M., Himanen P., The Information Society and the Welfare State: The Finnish Model, (2004); Collini S., What are Universities For?, (2012); Collins R., Broadcasting and Audio-Visual Policy in the European Single Market, (1994); Collins R., Wallerstein I., Collins R., Mann M., Et al., The end of middle-class work: No more escapes, Does Capitalism Have a Future?, pp. 37-69, (2014); Compano R., Pascu C., Bianchi A., Et al., The Future of the Information Society in Europe: Contributions to the Debate, Directorate-General Joint Research Centre, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, (2006); Crouch C., Making Capitalism Fit for Society, (2013); Horizon 2020 – The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, (2011); Towards a Thriving Data-Driven Economy, (2014); What is the Bologna Process?, (2015); Feather J., The Information Society: A Study of Continuity and Change, (2008); Freedman D., The Contradictions of Media Power, (2012); Friedman G., The crisis of the middle class and American power, Geopolitical Weekly, (2013); Gamble A., Crisis Without End?
